       "'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\\nof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\n\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that\\nNetherfield Park is let at last?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n\\n“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\\ntold me all about it.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\n\\n“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.\\n\\n“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“He came down to see the place”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\\n“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\\nin the house by the end of next week.”\\n\\n“What is his name?”\\n\\n“Bingley.”\\n\\n“Is he married or single?”\\n\\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\n\\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\\n\\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\\n\\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as he comes.”\\n\\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\\nparty.”\\n\\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\\n\\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\n\\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\n\\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\\nhim, if you do not.”\\n\\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\\n\\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\\n\\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.”\\n\\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\\n\\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese twenty years at least.”\\n\\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\n\\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\nvisit them.”\\n\\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\\nsuddenly addressed her with,--\\n\\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\\n\\n“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\\n\\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\\n\\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\\nof her.”\\n\\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\\nnot depend on her serving you.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n\\n“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\\n\\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\\nthem ill.”\\n\\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\\n\\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\\n\\n“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\\nshe will not know him herself.”\\n\\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”\\n\\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?”\\n\\n“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\\nwill take it on myself.”\\n\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\\nnonsense!”\\n\\n“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\\ngreat books, and make extracts.”\\n\\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\n\\n“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\\nBingley.”\\n\\n“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\\n\\n“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”\\n\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\\nwhile.\\n\\n“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\\nword about it till now.”\\n\\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\\n“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\\nfor your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\\nball.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\\ndinner.\\n\\n[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “He rode a black horse”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\\nin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\\nhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\\n\\n“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\\n\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten\\nminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\\nmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\\nwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\\n\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\\naccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\\nhe might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\nlittle by starting the idea of his\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “When the Party entered”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nbeing gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\\nreport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\\nnumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\\nthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,\\nhis five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\\n\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\\nthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\\nmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\\ndisagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\\nfriend.\\n\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\\nhimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\\nthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\n\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\\nMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his\\nfriend to join it.\\n\\n“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\\ndance.”\\n\\n“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\\nwould be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\\nstand up with.”\\n\\n“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a\\nkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\\nlife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,\\nuncommonly pretty.”\\n\\n“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.\\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\\n“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“She is tolerable”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\\n“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”\\n\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\\n\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\\nbook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\\nhad a very different story to hear.\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\nher twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\\n\\n“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\\n“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\\nhis partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\\nin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”\\n\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\\nshe admired him.\\n\\n“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\\nwith such perfect good breeding!”\\n\\n“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”\\n\\n“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\ndid not expect such a compliment.”\\n\\n“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\nstupider person.”\\n\\n“Dear Lizzy!”\\n\\n“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”\\n\\n“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\\nwhat I think.”\\n\\n“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\\nof the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”\\n\\n“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\nneighbour in her.”\\n\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\\nmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\\nacquired by trade.\\n\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\npurchase.\\n\\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\\nhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\\ngiving offence.\\n\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\\nmuch.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\\nfriendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\\ncourteous.\\n\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\\nElizabeth’s intimate friend.\\n\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\\n“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”\\n\\n“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\\n\\n“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\\nabout Mr. Robinson.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\nanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\\n\\n“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\\n\\n“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\\nCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”\\n\\n“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”\\n\\n[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\\n“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\\n\\n“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\\nspoke to.”\\n\\n“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless\\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\\nagreeable.”\\n\\n“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\\nto the ball in a hack chaise.”\\n\\n“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\\nwish he had danced with Eliza.”\\n\\n“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,\\nif I were you.”\\n\\n“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”\\n\\n“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride\\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\nto be proud.”\\n\\n“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\\n\\n“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\nreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\\n\\n“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\\nsisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”\\n\\n“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\\nBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\\ndirectly.”\\n\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the\\ngood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\\neverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\\nin all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\\nwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\\nLucas.\\n\\n“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\\n\\n“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\\ndiscover it too.”\\n\\n“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”\\n\\n“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\\nit, he must find it out.”\\n\\n“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\\nin love as much as she chooses.”\\n\\n“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\\nthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\\nenough to make her understand his character.”\\n\\n“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\\nevenings may do a great deal.”\\n\\n“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\\nlife.”\\n\\n“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\\n\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\\nallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\\nthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\\nto dance with.\\n\\nHe began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\\nassembled.\\n\\n“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\\nconversation with Colonel Forster?”\\n\\n“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\\n\\n“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\\n\\n[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George\\nAllen._]]\\n\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\\na subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\\nturned to him and said,--\\n\\n“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\\njust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\\nMeryton?”\\n\\n“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\\nenergetic.”\\n\\n“You are severe on us.”\\n\\n“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\\n\\n“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a\\nmusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\\nhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\\nshe added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\\nat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\\nof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\\nI shall keep mine to swell my song.”\\n\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\\nwould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\\nimpatient for display.\\n\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\\nsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\\ndancing at one end of the room.\\n\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--\\n\\n“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\\nnothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\\nrefinements of polished societies.”\\n\\n“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”\\n\\nSir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”\\n\\n“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\\nyou often dance at St. James’s?”\\n\\n“Never, sir.”\\n\\n“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\\n\\n“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\\n\\n“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\\n\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\n\\n“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”\\n\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\\nher,--\\n\\n“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--\\n\\n“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\\n\\n“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\\nfor one half hour.”\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\\n\\n“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\\npartner?”\\n\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--\\n\\n“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\\n\\n“I should imagine not.”\\n\\n“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\\nevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\\nyour opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\\nnoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\\npeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\\n\\n“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\\nMr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--\\n\\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\\n\\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\\nHow long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\\njoy?”\\n\\n“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\\n\\n“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\\n\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “A note for Miss Bennet”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\\nhad left her four thousand pounds.\\n\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.\\n\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\\nto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\\nnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\nsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\\nthe head-quarters.\\n\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\\nintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\\nofficers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\\nand at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\\nvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\\nunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\nan ensign.\\n\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\nBennet coolly observed,--\\n\\n“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\\nI am now convinced.”\\n\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\\nnext morning to London.\\n\\n“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\\nof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\\n\\n“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”\\n\\n“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\\n\\n“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\\nfoolish.”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\\nliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\\nshould want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\\nhis regimentals.”\\n\\n“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\\nnote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--\\n\\n“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\\n\\n“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n\\n     /* NIND “My dear friend, */\\n\\n     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\\n     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\\n     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\\n     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\\n     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\\n     Yours ever,\\n\\n“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”\\n\\n“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\\n_that_.”\\n\\n“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”\\n\\n“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\\n\\n“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\\nrain; and then you must stay all night.”\\n\\n“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\\nthey would not offer to send her home.”\\n\\n“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\\n\\n“I had much rather go in the coach.”\\n\\n“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\\n\\n[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]\\n\\n“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\\n\\n“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\\nwill be answered.”\\n\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\\nrained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\\nJane certainly could not come back.\\n\\n“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--\\n\\n     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */\\n\\n     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\\n     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\\n     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\\n     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\\n     headache, there is not much the matter with me.\\n\\n“Yours, etc.”\\n\\n“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\\n\\n“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\\ncarriage.”\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\n\\n“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\\nthere.”\\n\\n“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”\\n\\n“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\\nhorses?”\\n\\n“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\\n\\n“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\\n\\n“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\\ntogether.\\n\\n“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\\nsee something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”\\n\\nIn Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\nof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\\nover puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\\nwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.\\n\\nShe was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\\nbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\\ngood-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\\nnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\\nthe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\nthinking only of his breakfast.\\n\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\\nenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\\nhowever, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\\nher.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\\nnothing to do elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\\nat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\\npresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\\ndespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\\nback a supply of clothes.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The Apothecary came”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“covering a screen”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAt five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\nindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\n\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\\nattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\\neat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\npronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\\nthought the same, and added,--\\n\\n“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\nlooked almost wild.”\\n\\n“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\\n\\n“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\\nin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\\nhide it not doing its office.”\\n\\n“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\\nwhen she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\\nescaped my notice.”\\n\\n“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\\nan exhibition.”\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\n“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\\na most country-town indifference to decorum.”\\n\\n“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\\nBingley.\\n\\n“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\\neyes.”\\n\\n“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\\n\\n“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\\nchance of it.”\\n\\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton?”\\n\\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\\n\\n“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\\n\\n“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”\\n\\n“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\\n\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.\\n\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\\n“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\\n\\n“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\\n\\n“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\\n\\n“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\\n\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\nothers; all that his library afforded.\\n\\n“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\\nthan I ever looked into.”\\n\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\nin the room.\\n\\n“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\\n\\n“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\\ngenerations.”\\n\\n“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\\nbooks.”\\n\\n“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\nthese.”\\n\\n“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.”\\n\\n“I wish it may.”\\n\\n“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”\\n\\n“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\\n\\n“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\\n\\n“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\\n\\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\\nsister, to observe the game.\\n\\n“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\\nshe be as tall as I am?”\\n\\n“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\\nrather taller.”\\n\\n“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\\n\\n“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.”\\n\\n“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\\n\\n“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\\nnet purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\\nsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\\nbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”\\n\\n“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\\nacquaintance that are really accomplished.”\\n\\n“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\\n\\n“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\\nidea of an accomplished woman.”\\n\\n“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\nwill be but half deserved.”\\n\\n“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\\nsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\\nreading.”\\n\\n“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\\n\\n“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\\nthis?”\\n\\n“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\nroom.\\n\\n“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\\nsex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\\nsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\ndespicable.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\ncontinue the subject.\\n\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for\\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\\nunwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\nhowever, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\\nhis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\\npossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nM^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the\\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\\ninquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\\nown judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and\\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\\ntwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\n\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\\nwould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\nit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\nBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\\n“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\\na little longer on your kindness.”\\n\\n“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\nsure, will not hear of her removal.”\\n\\n“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\n“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\\nremains with us.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\\n“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\\nvast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\\ntemper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\\n_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\\nover that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\\nequal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\\nhope, though you have but a short lease.”\\n\\n“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\\n\\n“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\\n\\n“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”\\n\\n“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\nthrough, I am afraid, is pitiful.”\\n\\n“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\\n\\n“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\\n\\n“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\\na studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\\n\\n“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\\nleast that advantage.”\\n\\n“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\\nunvarying society.”\\n\\n“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\nobserved in them for ever.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\\ncountry neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\\ngoing on in the country as in town.”\\n\\nEverybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\nvictory over him, continued her triumph,--\\n\\n“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\npleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\\n\\n“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\\nwhen I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\\n\\n“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\ngentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\\nat all.”\\n\\n“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\nmother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\\nyou must acknowledge to be true.”\\n\\n“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\\n\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\\nsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\\n\\n“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\\ngenteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\\nimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”\\n\\n“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\\n\\n“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\\nwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to\\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I\\nassure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\\nCharlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”\\n\\n“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.\\n\\n“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast\\nof my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\\npartiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my\\nbrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my\\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\\nBut, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”\\n\\n“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has\\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\\n\\n“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.\\n\\n“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”\\n\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\\nindeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\neach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\n\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her\\nown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\\nvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\\nball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\\nthe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\\nto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.\\n\\n“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”\\n\\nLydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to\\nwait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\\nadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the\\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\\nall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined\\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\n\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.\\n\\n“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\\n\\nHe made no answer.\\n\\n“You write uncommonly fast.”\\n\\n“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”\\n\\n“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”\\n\\n“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”\\n\\n“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\\n\\n“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\\n\\n“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\\npens remarkably well.”\\n\\n“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”\\n\\n“How can you contrive to write so even?”\\n\\nHe was silent.\\n\\n“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\\nGrantley’s.”\\n\\n“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\\npresent I have not room to do them justice.”\\n\\n“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\n“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\\nto determine.”\\n\\n“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\\nease cannot write ill.”\\n\\n“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\\nbrother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much\\nfor words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\\n\\n“My style of writing is very different from yours.”\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way\\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”\\n\\n“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which\\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”\\n\\n“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”\\n\\n“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\\nindirect boast.”\\n\\n“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”\\n\\n“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”\\n\\n“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the\\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”\\n\\n“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay\\ntill next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not\\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.”\\n\\n“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did\\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\\nmore than he did himself.”\\n\\n“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my\\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a\\ncircumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\\ncould.”\\n\\n“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\\n\\n“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for\\nhimself.”\\n\\n“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\\none argument in favour of its propriety.”\\n\\n“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\nwith you.”\\n\\n“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\neither.”\\n\\n“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\\n\\n“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\nbetween the parties?”\\n\\n“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\\nforgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\\nknow a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\\nwhen he has nothing to do.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\\nrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\\n\\n“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\\nand want to silence this.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\\n\\n“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\\nfor the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\\nthe pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\\nway, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\\nseated herself.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\\nElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\nadmiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\\nhe disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her\\nmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\\nany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\\n\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\\nElizabeth, said to her,--\\n\\n“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\nopportunity of dancing a reel?”\\n\\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\nsurprise at her silence.\\n\\n“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\\nyou that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\\ndare.”\\n\\n“Indeed I do not dare.”\\n\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\\nnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\\nbelieved that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\\nshould be in some danger.\\n\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great\\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\\n“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\\nnext day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\nand if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after\\nthe officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\\nwhich your lady possesses.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “No, no; stay where you are”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”\\n\\n“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed\\nin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\\njudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\\nlines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it\\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”\\n\\n“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\\ncopied.”\\n\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\nElizabeth herself.\\n\\n“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some\\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\\n“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without\\ntelling us that you were coming out.”\\n\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\\nand immediately said,--\\n\\n“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\\navenue.”\\n\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\\nlaughingly answered,--\\n\\n“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to\\nuncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\\nfourth. Good-bye.”\\n\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of\\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\\nas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Piling up the fire”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\\nseeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\\nwhere she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\\npleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were\\nduring the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\\nof conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\\nwith accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\n\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\\nMiss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\\nhimself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\\nalso made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\\nand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\\nattention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\\nto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\\ndoor. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\\nElizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\\ndelight.\\n\\nWhen tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\nDarcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\\nsilence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\\nHurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the\\nsofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\\nBennet.\\n\\nMiss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\nDarcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\\nperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\nquestion and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\\nan excellent library.”\\n\\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\\ntowards him and said,--\\n\\n“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\\nsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\\npleasure.”\\n\\n“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\\nchooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\nthing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\\nround my cards.”\\n\\n“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\\nday.”\\n\\n“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\\nnear so much like a ball.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\\ndesperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\\nturning to Elizabeth, said,--\\n\\n“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\\nlong in one attitude.”\\n\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\\ninterfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\nmeaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.\\n\\n“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be\\nsevere on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\\nnothing about it.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\\nanything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\\ntwo motives.\\n\\n“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\\nas she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\\nthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret\\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\\ncompletely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\\nas I sit by the fire.”\\n\\n“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\\n\\n“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\\ncan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\\nas you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\\n\\n“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\\nyet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\\nno; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\\nDarcy may hug himself.”\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\\nlaugh.”\\n\\n“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The\\nwisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\\nbe rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\\njoke.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am\\nnot one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\\nand nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\\nlaugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\\nyou are without.”\\n\\n“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\\nunderstanding to ridicule.”\\n\\n“Such as vanity and pride.”\\n\\n“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\\nsuperiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”\\n\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\\n“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\\n“and pray what is the result?”\\n\\n“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\\nhimself without disguise.”\\n\\n“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\\nfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\\never.”\\n\\n“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\\n\\n“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\\n\\n“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\\n\\n“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\nconversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my\\nwaking Mr. Hurst.”\\n\\nHer sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for\\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\\nnext morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\\nthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\\nwould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive\\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\nleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\\nwell. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\\ncontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\\nJane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike\\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\n\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\\nshe felt herself to be right.\\n\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\\nBingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\\nwisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\\nshould _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\n\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\\nall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits.\\n\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its\\nanimation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and\\nElizabeth.\\n\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human\\nnature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of\\nthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\\nfor them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said\\nin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\\nhad dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it\\nhad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\nbreakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”\\n\\n“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners\\nare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”\\n\\n“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\\nBingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly\\nthing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.\\nBut--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got\\nto-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this\\nmoment.”\\n\\n“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I\\nnever saw in the whole course of my life.”\\n\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\\neagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.\\n\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\nexplained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a\\nfortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,\\nand requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\npleases.”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\\nchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\\nto do something or other about it.”\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\nThey had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.\\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\\n“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little\\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.”\\n\\n“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of\\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\\nfriends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father\\ndid before him?”\\n\\n“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\\nhead, as you will hear.”\\n\\n     /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */\\n\\n“Dear Sir,\\n\\n     “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\\n     father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the\\n     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the\\n     breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,\\n     fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be\\n     on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be\\n     at variance.”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--“My mind, however, is now\\n     made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,\\n     I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of\\n     the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis\\n     de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the\\n     valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest\\n     endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\n     Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies\\n     which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,\\n     moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing\\n     of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on\\n     these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of\\n     good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my\\n     being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly\\n     overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered\\n     olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the\\n     means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to\\n     apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make\\n     them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should\\n     have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself\\n     the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\n     November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your\\n     hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do\\n     without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting\\n     to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other\\n     clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,\\n     with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your\\n     well-wisher and friend,\\n\\n“WILLIAM COLLINS.”\\n\\n“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”\\nsaid Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most\\nconscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will\\nprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\\nindulgent as to let him come to us again.”\\n\\n“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if\\nhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\\ndiscourage him.”\\n\\n“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean\\nto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\\ncredit.”\\n\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady\\nCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\\nhis parishioners whenever it were required.\\n\\n“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There\\nis something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by\\napologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would\\nhelp it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”\\n\\n“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\\nletter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”\\n\\n“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem\\ndefective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\\nthink it is well expressed.”\\n\\nTo Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any\\ndegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\\nastonished her husband and daughters.\\n\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\npoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need\\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,\\nheavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\\ndoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This\\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\\nBennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--\\n\\n“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\\noddly.”\\n\\n“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”\\n\\n“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,\\nI know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.”\\n\\n“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,\\nwhen we are better acquainted----”\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\nown future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;\\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its\\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\\nhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good\\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a\\nquarter of an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\\nto more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\\napprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\npeople, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\\ntwo to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.\\n\\n“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I\\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”\\n\\n“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\\nfrom Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”\\n\\n“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”\\n\\n“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\nextensive property.”\\n\\n“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than\\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”\\n\\n“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\\naccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”\\n\\n“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\\ncourt.”\\n\\n“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\\nthe British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased\\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\npay.”\\n\\n“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you\\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?”\\n\\n“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\\nas he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\\nin his pleasure.\\n\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\\nto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,\\nglad to invite him\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Protested\\nthat he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94\\n]\\n\\nto read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\\nwas produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be\\nfrom a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,\\nprotested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\\nexclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he\\nchose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and\\nbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\\ninterrupted him with,--\\n\\n“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away\\nRichard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”\\n\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--\\n\\n“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\\nme, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to\\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”\\n\\nThen, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\\nbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.\\nBennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s\\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\\nfor backgammon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\\nhad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful\\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good\\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\n\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s\\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\npart.\\n\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\\nof an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to\\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\\n_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to\\nhint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”\\n\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.\\n\\nLydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister\\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,\\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\\ngo.\\n\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\\nwere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and\\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in\\na shop window, could recall them.\\n\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\\nMr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\\nhe bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\\nto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\\nsomething in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\\npavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\\nWhat could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\n\\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\\nMr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s\\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\\nPhilips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\\ninvitation.\\n\\nMrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had\\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\\napologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\\nher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\\nappeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\\ndisagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\\nwith unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.\\n\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\\nbehaviour than her sister.\\n\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\\nPhilips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAs no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their\\naunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in\\nthe house.\\n\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\\nwith the housekeeper’s room.\\n\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\\nThe gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\\ngentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\\nMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The officers of the ----shire”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\\nskill of the speaker.\\n\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.\\n\\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\\nin return, by sitting down to whist.\\n\\n“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\n\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\\nmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n\\n“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\ndrop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\nunderstand.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\\nconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\\n“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\n“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\ndisagreeable.”\\n\\n“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\nastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\\n\\n“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\\n\\n“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\\ninterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\\n\\n“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\nill-tempered man.”\\n\\nWickham only shook his head.\\n\\n“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.”\\n\\n“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\nmemory of his father.”\\n\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\n\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\n\\n“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\\n“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\nwere speaking of just now.”\\n\\n“Indeed!”\\n\\n“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\nelsewhere.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\\nwill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”\\n\\n“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\\nCertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\nfreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”\\n\\n“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\\n\\n“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\\n\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\never as he expressed them.\\n\\n“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”\\n\\n“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\nof preference which was often given me.”\\n\\n“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\nthis!”\\n\\nAfter a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\\nmust be dreadful.”\\n\\n“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\\nhardly be just to him.”\\n\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\\nwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\\nmanner.”\\n\\n“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\npart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\\nappears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\\nand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\\nto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”\\n\\n“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\\ndishonesty I must call it.”\\n\\n“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\nimpulses even than pride.”\\n\\n“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\\n\\n“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\\nfather was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.”\\n\\n“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”\\n\\nHe shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\neducation.”\\n\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,--\\n\\n“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\\nwho seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\\nknow Mr. Bingley?”\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\\nDarcy is.”\\n\\n“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\\nnever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\\nsincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\\nsomething for fortune and figure.”\\n\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\\nher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\\nmake herself uneasy.\\n\\n“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\\ncard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\\nare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\nlittle matters.”\\n\\nMr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.\\n\\n“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\\n\\n“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”\\n\\n“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\nyesterday.”\\n\\n“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”\\n\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\nself-destined to another.\\n\\n“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her\\nLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\\nher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”\\n\\n“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have\\nnot seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\\nchooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\\nthe first class.”\\n\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\\nan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\nWickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\\nMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “delighted to see their dear friend again”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.\\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she\\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\nBingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the\\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to\\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\\ndone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\\notherwise explained.\\n\\n“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\\nother, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\\nwithout actual blame on either side.”\\n\\n“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\\nbusiness? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\\nsomebody.”\\n\\n“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\\nmanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh no.”\\n\\n“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that\\nMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last\\nnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not\\nso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”\\n\\n“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\\nthink.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”\\n\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\\nBingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when\\nthe affair became public.\\n\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\\nfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see\\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.\\n\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\\nless on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\\nhad no disinclination for it.\\n\\n“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\\neverybody.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he\\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\\neither from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\\ndance.\\n\\n“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a\\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.”\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\\ninstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\\nfor, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\\ntrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\\nof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\\nTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\\npleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\\nsmile,--\\n\\n“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”\\n\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\nElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\nWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\nAttention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\n\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\nspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\\nhad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\\ntransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\\nparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\\ndistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\\nsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\\ndisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\\nrelease from him was ecstasy.\\n\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\\nmind: Charlotte tried to console her.\\n\\n“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\\n\\n“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\\nevil.”\\n\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\nin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\nreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\\nwith--\\n\\n“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\\ndance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\\nroom, or the number of couples.”\\n\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\nsaid.\\n\\n“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\\n_now_ we may be silent.”\\n\\n“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\\n\\n“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.”\\n\\n“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?”\\n\\n“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\nposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\\n\\n“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\\nsaid he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”\\n\\n“I must not decide on my own performance.”\\n\\nHe made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\\nthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.”\\n\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\nconstrained manner said,--\\n\\n“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\\n_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\\nis less certain.”\\n\\n“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\\nwith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\nhis life.”\\n\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\\nhis dancing and his partner.\\n\\n“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\\nat her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Such very superior dancing is not\\noften seen.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\nWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--\\n\\n“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\\nof.”\\n\\n“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\\nthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\\n\\n“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\\n\\n“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.”\\n\\n“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\\n\\n“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\nsomething else.”\\n\\n“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\\nwith a look of doubt.\\n\\n“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\nthat you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\ncreated_?”\\n\\n“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\\n\\n“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\\n\\n“I hope not.”\\n\\n“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.”\\n\\n“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\\n\\n“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\\nto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”\\n\\n“And what is your success?”\\n\\nShe shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\\n\\n“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\\n\\n“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\nopportunity.”\\n\\n“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\\nin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\\nanother.\\n\\nThey had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\\nwith an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--\\n\\n“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\nquestions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\\nother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\\nDarcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\\nimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\\nhim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\\nmost infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\\nwell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\\nto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\\ncould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\\nI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\\ndiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\\ndescent, one could not expect much better.”\\n\\n“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\\nsaid Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\\nassure you, he informed me himself.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”\\n\\n“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\nDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\\nfor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\\n“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\nsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\\nyou may be sure of my pardon.”\\n\\n“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\nthe probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\\nsister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\\nregard.”\\n\\n“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\\n\\n“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\\n\\n“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\nperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\\n\\n“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\nhim _conditionally_ only.”\\n\\n“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\\n“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\nBingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\\nboth gentlemen as I did before.”\\n\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\\ndelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\\nBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\nand told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\\nas to make a most important discovery.\\n\\n“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\\nin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\\n\\n“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\n“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\\nassure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\\n\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\\nthe determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\\nspeaking, replied thus,--\\n\\n“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\\nsame time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\\ndictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\\nwhat I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\\nyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\\nthough in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\\nyourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\\nbeing so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\\n“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\nunrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\\nreplied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\\n“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\\n\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\\nher perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\\nvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\\neven to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\\nsaw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\\nlest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\\nshe considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\\none of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\\ntalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\\nelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\\nBingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\\nof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\\na charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\\nwere the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\\ncomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\\ncertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\\nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\\nJane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\\nand, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\\nconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\\nnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\\nto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\\noccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\nchance of it.\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s\\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\\n“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\\n\\n“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you\\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\nso doing.”\\n\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\\nblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\nsteady gravity.\\n\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\nentreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\nElizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\\nshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\\namongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\\nbegan another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\\nShe looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\ntalking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\nimpenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\\nand, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--\\n\\n“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\\n\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\\n\\n“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\\nan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\\neverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\\nshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\\nconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\\nroom. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\\nhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\\nLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\n\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\nsomebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\\nroom. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\\nto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\\nhimself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\\nclose to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\\nproject. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\\noften joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\\nto herself.\\n\\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\nit.\\n\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\\nmanœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\\nhour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\\nspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\\nhow tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\\npleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\\nwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\\ngo the next day for a short time.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “to assure you in the most animated language”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--\\n\\n“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\ncourse of this morning?”\\n\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\nBennet instantly answered,--\\n\\n“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\\nshe can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\ncalled out,--\\n\\n“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\\ngoing away myself.”\\n\\n“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And\\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\\nto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\\nMr. Collins.”\\n\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\\nto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\\nsoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--\\n\\n“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\\nmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\\n\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\\nhe continued,--\\n\\n“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\\nvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\\nhave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\nleft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\narranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\nin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\\n\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\\n“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\\nanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\\nthem.”\\n\\n“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\nhand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\\njust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\\n\\n“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\nwould make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\nsituation.”\\n\\n“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\\nvery gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.”\\n\\n“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\\nbelieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\\naddressed her,--\\n\\n“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\\nfirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\nfemale character.”\\n\\n“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\nmay convince you of its being one.”\\n\\n“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\nrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\\nis unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\\nwith the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\nconsideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\\nportion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the\\neffects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\\ntherefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\\n\\n“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\\ntruth from her heart.”\\n\\n“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\\ngallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\nbeing acceptable.”\\n\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\n\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been\\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\\nand could not help saying so.\\n\\n“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\\na very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\\nI will _make_ her know it.”\\n\\n“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she\\nis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\\nforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\\n\\n“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\\n\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\nhusband, called out, as she entered the library,--\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\\nnot have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\\nnot have _her_.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\\non her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by\\nher communication.\\n\\n“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had\\nfinished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”\\n\\n“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”\\n\\n“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”\\n\\n“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\\nmarrying him.”\\n\\n“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for\\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?”\\n\\nElizabeth replied that it was.\\n\\n“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”\\n\\n“I have, sir.”\\n\\n“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\\n\\n“Yes, or I will never see her again.”\\n\\n“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\\nif you _do_.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\\n“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\\nto _insist_ upon her marrying him.”\\n\\n“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.\\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\\npresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.”\\n\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\\nher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\\nvaried, however, her determination never did.\\n\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\\ndeserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\\nher, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “they entered the breakfast room”\\n]\\n\\nCharlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,\\nwho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her\\nfamily. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;\\n“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,\\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.”\\n\\nCharlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\n“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as\\nmay be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she\\ncan have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it\\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\\nto maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep\\nyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\\nand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\\nto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\\nto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\\nno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\\nis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”\\n\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\\nattempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\\nShe talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\\nthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--\\n\\n“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\\nlet Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”\\n\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\\nconversation:--\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Collins!”\\n\\n“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.\\nFar be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\\ndispleasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\\ninevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man\\nwho has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I\\ntrust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\nhave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\\nfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\\ndaughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\\nMy conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\\ndismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\\nliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\\nAs for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\\nby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\\nstiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\\nher; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\nespecially to her friend.\\n\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill\\nhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\\nnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\\nSaturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham\\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\\naunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were\\nwell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\n\\n“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\\nMr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\\n\\nShe highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full\\ndiscussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly\\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\\nthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.\\nHis accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the\\ncompliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an\\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\n\\n[Illustration: “Walked back with them”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\\nfrom Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a\\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\\nJane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\\njoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they\\nhad gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\\nfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\\nto town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\\nwhat she says.”\\n\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\\nregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\\ndearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\\nreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\\nmeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these\\nhigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\\nsaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\\ncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.\\n\\n“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\nhope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.\\n\\n“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\\nalready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\\nwhom we shall deprive you.’\\n\\n“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this\\nwinter.”\\n\\n“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”\\n\\n“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.\\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\\nimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\\nless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\\nher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\\nshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\\nmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\\nyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\ncapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\nof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\\nJane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\\ndeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\\nthat she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\\nif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\\nkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\\nsubject?”\\n\\n“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”\\n\\n“Most willingly.”\\n\\n“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\nin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\ndoes not care about you.”\\n\\nJane shook her head.\\n\\n“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\\ntogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\\ncase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\\nthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\\ndare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\\ndearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\nTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”\\n\\n“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\\nherself.”\\n\\n“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\nwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”\\n\\n“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\nelsewhere?”\\n\\n“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,\\nby all means, to refuse him.”\\n\\n“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\nnot hesitate.”\\n\\n“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\\nyour situation with much compassion.”\\n\\n“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months.”\\n\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\\ninterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\nso totally independent of everyone.\\n\\nShe represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\nBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.\\n\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\\nthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\\nLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\\nthat, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\\ncare to have two full courses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\\nhumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”\\n\\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\\nvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\\nhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\\ncharacter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\\nreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\n\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\\nthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\nestablishment were gained.\\n\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\\nexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\\ninterest than the matter had ever\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “So much love and eloquence”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nexcited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\\nSir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\\nshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\\nexpedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\\nJames’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\\noccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\\nfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\\nto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\\nirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\\nbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\\nmarriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\\nprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\\nfrom want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\\ntwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\\nluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\\nsurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\\nvalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\\nto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\\nquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\npublish his prosperous love.\\n\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\\nthe family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\\nmoved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\\ncordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,\\nwhenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n\\n“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\\nmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\npossible.”\\n\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\\nso speedy a return, immediately said,--\\n\\n“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my\\ngood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\\noffending your patroness.”\\n\\n“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\\nmaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”\\n\\n“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”\\n\\n“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\naffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\\nthough my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\\nnow take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\\nmy cousin Elizabeth.”\\n\\nWith proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\\nsurprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\n\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\\nas that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\\nshe could not help crying out,--\\n\\n“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”\\n\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\\nstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\\nher composure, and calmly replied,--\\n\\n“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\\n\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\\nfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\\nwished her all imaginable happiness.\\n\\n“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\\nvery much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\\nBut when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\\nwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\nentering the marriage state.”\\n\\nElizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\\nlonger; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\\nnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\\nherself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\\nshe had chosen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,\\nwhen Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\\nhouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\\nbut incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always\\nunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\\n\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\nwithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\\nmost forbearing courtesy.\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\\ntogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\nconsole and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\\nscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\\nor Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\\ncould at all forgive their daughter.\\n\\nMr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\\nmore foolish than his daughter!\\n\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\\nto spread at Meryton.\\n\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\\nMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\\nthough Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\\nenough to drive happiness away.\\n\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\\n\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\\ntwelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\\ndischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\\nwith many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\\naffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\\nthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\\nLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;\\nfor Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\\nshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would\\nbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early\\nday for making him the happiest of men.\\n\\nMr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\\nabsence.\\n\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\\nfalsehood.\\n\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\\nwas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\\nfrequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\\nthe strength of his attachment.\\n\\nAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\\npainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of\\nconcealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\\ndid not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all\\nJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\ntranquillity.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\\nfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\\nand, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”\\n]\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and\\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\nand her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She\\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n\\n“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte\\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced\\nto make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”\\n\\n“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”\\n\\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of\\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.\\n\\n“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”\\n\\n“What should not you mind?”\\n\\n“I should not mind anything at all.”\\n\\n“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\ninsensibility.”\\n\\n“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own\\ndaughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!\\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”\\n\\n“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMiss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\\nthe country.\\n\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\\ninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\\n\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\\nfor her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s\\nassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\\nthe caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;\\nwhether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\n\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a\\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\\nnot help saying,--\\n\\n“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no\\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I\\nwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\\nall be as we were before.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no\\nreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\nacquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\\nnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\\ntime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”\\n\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,\\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.”\\n\\n“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness\\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\\nyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\\ndeserve.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\\nthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.\\n\\n“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\\nafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\\nor sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,\\nthe other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\\nis unaccountable!”\\n\\n“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\\nsituation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and\\nCharlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\\nlarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be\\nready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\\nregard and esteem for our cousin.”\\n\\n“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\\ndanger security for happiness.”\\n\\n“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied\\nJane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\\nour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\\nit does.”\\n\\n“And men take care that they should.”\\n\\n“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”\\n\\n“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”\\nsaid Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\\nunhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\\nwant of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,\\nwill do the business.”\\n\\n“And do you impute it to either of those?”\\n\\n“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I\\nthink of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”\\n\\n“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”\\n\\n“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\\n\\n“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can\\nsecure it.”\\n\\n“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\\nhappiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\\nconnections, and pride.”\\n\\n“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;\\n“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\\nknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\\nthey should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think\\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\\npart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s\\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\\nmore; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\\nfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\\nwith less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\\ncomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one\\nday, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next\\nto being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and\\nthen. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction\\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\\nbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\\nbe your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\\nall expect Jane’s good fortune.”\\n\\n“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\\nalways make the most of it.”\\n\\nMr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\\npleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\\nhad known anything of the matter.\\n\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any\\nextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of\\nHertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else\\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.\\nCollins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\\nSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\\nside by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to\\nhope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\\nwould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave\\nof his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\\nhis fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\\nanother letter of thanks.\\n\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\\nbrother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at\\nLongbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\\ntrade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\nwoman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two\\neldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.\\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.\\n\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\\ndone, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\\ngirls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\\nin it.\\n\\n“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.\\nBingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think\\nthat she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it\\nbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\\nand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\\na daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\\nmuch entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,\\nsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\\nthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\\nso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\nbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of\\nlong sleeves.”\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\\nthe course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her\\nsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\\nconversation.\\n\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\\n“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I\\nam sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,\\nsuch as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty\\ngirl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily\\nforgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Offended two or three young ladies”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not\\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen\\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\\nlove with only a few days before.”\\n\\n“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\\noften applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_\\nMr. Bingley’s love?”\\n\\n“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\\noffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I\\nspoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be\\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would\\nbe prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\\nservice--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\\nanything.”\\n\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\\nof her sister’s ready acquiescence.\\n\\n“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to\\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\\nunless he really comes to see her.”\\n\\n“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\\npart of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,\\nperhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\\nwould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\\nnever stirs without him.”\\n\\n“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”\\n\\n“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\\n\\nBut, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being\\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\\nhis affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s\\nattractions.\\n\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she\\nhoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she\\nmight occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\\nseeing him.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\\nmade part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\\non these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s\\nwarm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\\nthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\\nresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\\nan attachment.\\n\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part\\nof Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\\nacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\\nthe death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power\\nto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been\\nin the way of procuring.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\ncharacter perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible\\nsubject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with\\nthe minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her\\ntribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was\\ndelighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the\\npresent Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\\nthat gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might\\nagree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having\\nheard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,\\nill-natured boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Will you come and see me?”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on\\nthe first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after\\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--\\n\\n“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\\nare warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\\nopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\\nyourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of\\nfortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\\n_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\\n\\n“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\\n\\n“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\\n\\n“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\\ncan prevent it.”\\n\\n“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with\\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\\nof it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does\\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\\nsince we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are\\nseldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\\nof my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that\\nit would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is\\nnot to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his\\nfirst object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In\\nshort, I will do my best.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\\noften. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”\\n\\n“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very\\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\\nthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the\\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you\\nare satisfied.”\\n\\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for\\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice\\nbeing given on such a point without being resented.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the\\nLucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His\\nmarriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned\\nas to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured\\ntone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the\\nwedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and\\nwhen she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\\naccompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,\\nCharlotte said,--\\n\\n“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\\n\\n“_That_ you certainly shall.”\\n\\n“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”\\n\\n“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\\n\\n“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\\ncome to Hunsford.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\\nvisit.\\n\\n“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and\\nI hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be\\nas welcome to me as either of them.”\\n\\nThe wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\\nthe church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the\\nsubject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their\\ncorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it\\nshould be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;\\nand, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\\nsake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters\\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\\nwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most\\nfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and\\nRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\nfor her own visit there, to know the rest.\\n\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their\\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\\ngenerally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or\\nhearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\\nher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\\nlost.\\n\\n“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the\\ntown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”\\n\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\\n“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very\\nglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\\nto London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.\\nI inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\\nengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\\nsoon see them here.”\\n\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.\\n\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\\nblind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning\\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet\\nmore, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself\\nno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\\nwill prove what she felt:--\\n\\n     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\n     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have\\n     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my\\n     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\\n     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour\\n     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\\n     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,\\n     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\\n     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\\n     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she\\n     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she\\n     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a\\n     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so\\n     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\\n     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\\n     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\\n     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\\n     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\\n     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\\n     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all\\n     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\\n     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\\n     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\\n     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\\n     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful\\n     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\\n     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear\\n     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never\\n     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\n     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely\\n     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at\\n     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am\\n     sure you will be very comfortable there.\\n\\n“Yours, etc.”\\n\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she\\nconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\\neven wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every\\nreview of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\\nDarcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly\\nregret what he had thrown away.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had\\nsuch to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\\nherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\\nhe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\\nwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\\npermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\nremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\\nin Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\\nNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to\\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\\nsincerely wish him happy.\\n\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the\\ncircumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\\nthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that\\npure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\\nand wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\\ntowards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think\\nher a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\\nwatchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love\\nwith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\\nhis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways\\nof the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\\nhandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the\\nplain.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “On the Stairs”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\\ndiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\\nsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the\\nplan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater\\npleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire\\nof seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.\\nThere was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give\\nher a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was\\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of\\nspending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as\\nperfect as plan could be.\\n\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\n\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\\nopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\\nwas a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to\\nhim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,\\nwhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\\nand pleasing.\\n\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think\\nhim less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\\ngood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\\nthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\\ndelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\\nshe had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\\nthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\\nworn out, like his information.\\n\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\\nas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s\\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when\\nthey entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\\nwhose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to\\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\\nfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her\\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\\nher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\\nhope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\\n\\n“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I\\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\\n\\n“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\\nand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\\ngirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\\nmercenary.”\\n\\n“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\\nwhat to think.”\\n\\n“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”\\n\\n“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death\\nmade her mistress of this fortune?”\\n\\n“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\naffections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\\npoor?”\\n\\n“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so\\nsoon after this event.”\\n\\n“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\\nwhy should _we_?”\\n\\n“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”\\n\\n“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\nmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”\\n\\n“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”\\n\\n“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\\nDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow\\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\\nneither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\\nworth knowing, after all.”\\n\\n“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”\\n\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n\\n“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.\\nGardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”\\n\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear\\naunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me\\nfresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men\\nto rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And\\nwhen we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where\\nwe have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,\\nand rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when\\nwe attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling\\nabout its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less\\ninsupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “At the door”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEvery object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\\n\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\\nThe paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\n\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,\\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\\nappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which\\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\\ncoming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\\ninstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:\\nhis formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\\nin the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\\nformality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s\\noffers of refreshment.\\n\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,\\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\\neverything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,\\nthat she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\\nCollins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\\nwhich certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\\nCharlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire\\nevery article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the\\nfender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\\nwhich he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\nthe country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\\nthe prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\\nbordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\\nhandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\\nElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\\nCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\\nforgotten.\\n\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\\nin, observed,--\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\\nservice is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\\ninclude you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\nwalk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\\n_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\\n\\n“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added\\nCharlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\\n\\n“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\\n\\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\\ntelling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\\nCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\\npass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse\\nwith Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\\nconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\\nupstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\\nthe door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with\\nagitation, cried out,--\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “In Conversation with the ladies”\\n\\n[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\\nhaste, and come down this moment.”\\n\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;\\nand down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest\\nof this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the\\ngarden gate.\\n\\n“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs\\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter!”\\n\\n“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady\\nCatherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\\nother is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\\ncreature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”\\n\\n“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\\nWhy does she not come in?”\\n\\n“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\\nwhen Miss De Bourgh comes in.”\\n\\n“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She\\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\\nmake him a very proper wife.”\\n\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was\\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that\\nway.\\n\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\\nto dine at Rosings the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     ‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of\\ndoing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady\\nCatherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\\n“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\\nher Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening\\nat Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\\nit would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\\nWho could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine\\nthere (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\\nimmediately after your arrival?”\\n\\n“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\\n“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\\nmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\\ninstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\\n\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\\nthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\\n\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\\nElizabeth,--\\n\\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\\nbecomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\\nfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\\nbeing simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\\npreserved.”\\n\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\\nher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\\nwho had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her\\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\\nto his presentation at St. James’s.\\n\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\\nacross the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\n\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\\nincreasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\\nElizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\\nthought she could witness without trepidation.\\n\\nFrom the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\\nthe servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\\nher daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\\nwhich he would have thought necessary.\\n\\nIn spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\\ncomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\\nsilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\\nmarked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\\nElizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she\\nbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\\n\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\nher eyes.\\n\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\\nlooking at in the summer.\\n\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\\nand all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\\nhad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\\nher Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\\nnothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\\nand every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\\nwas now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\\nCatherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\\ngracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\\nto them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\\nto speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\\nthe dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\\nlittle Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\\nfearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\\nand the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\\nsubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\\nher judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\\nbeneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an\\noccasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\\nMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\\nthe least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\\npretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\nmother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\nquestions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\\nobserved,--\\n\\n“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\\nsake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\\nBennet?”\\n\\n“A little.”\\n\\n“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\\n\\n“One of them does.”\\n\\n“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\\nWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\\nyou draw?”\\n\\n“No, not at all.”\\n\\n“What, none of you?”\\n\\n“Not one.”\\n\\n“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\\nshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\\n\\n“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\\n\\n“Has your governess left you?”\\n\\n“We never had any governess.”\\n\\n“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\\nhave been quite a slave to your education.”\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\\nbeen the case.\\n\\n“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\\nhave been neglected.”\\n\\n“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\\nidle certainly might.”\\n\\n“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\\none. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\\nwas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\\nCatherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, all.”\\n\\n“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\\nyounger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\\nbe very young?”\\n\\n“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much\\nin company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon\\nyounger sisters that they should not have their share of society and\\namusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\\nmarry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\\nas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\\nfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\\n\\n“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\\nLadyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n\\n“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\\nconceal your age.”\\n\\n“I am not one-and-twenty.”\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\\nexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or\\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\\nfor every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\\nand noble names.\\n\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\\nthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\\ngratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\\narrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\nCollins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As\\nsoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\\ncousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\\nfor Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\\nsatisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s\\npraise into his own hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long\\nenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,\\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\\nmornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but\\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\ncousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast\\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in\\nreading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,\\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\\nElizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\\nthe dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\\npleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\nmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and\\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n\\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\\nalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\\na few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\nprevailed on to get out.\\n\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\\nhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\\nout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.\\n\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the\\ncommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\\nMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\\nquarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\\nthem into harmony and plenty.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “he never failed to inform them”\\n]\\n\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\\nof the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,\\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\\ncomfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\\nshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.\\n\\nIn this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were\\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him\\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\\nby Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\\nMiss Lucas and herself.\\n\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\\nin order to have\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The gentlemen accompanied him.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nthe earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage\\nturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\\ntwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought\\nwith him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;\\nand, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,\\nthe gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her\\nhusband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the\\nother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--\\n\\n“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”\\n\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment\\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\\ncourtesied to him, without saying a word.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\\nway; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--\\n\\n“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\\nhappened to see her there?”\\n\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see\\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\\nsubject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“At Church”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\\ntheir engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\\nhouse they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\\nalmost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by\\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\\nof either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\\nat the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\\nonly seen at church.\\n\\nThe invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined\\nthe party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them\\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a\\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,\\nmoreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\\nspirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\\nwell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a\\nwhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\\nscruple to call out,--\\n\\n“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”\\n\\n“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid\\na reply.\\n\\n“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\\nenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever\\nlearnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her\\nhealth had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\\n\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.\\n\\n“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\\nCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\\nif she does not practise a great deal.”\\n\\n“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.\\nShe practises very constantly.”\\n\\n“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\\ntell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will\\nnever play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\nJenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part\\nof the house.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made\\nno answer.\\n\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,\\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s\\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\\nconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--\\n\\n“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\\nme. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.\\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\\nthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\\nintimidate me.”\\n\\n“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could\\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,\\nare not your own.”\\n\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\\npart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\\nof credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\\nand such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\\n\\n“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.\\n\\n“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\\nFitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”\\n\\n“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The\\nfirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at\\na ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four\\ndances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four\\ndances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more\\nthan one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,\\nyou cannot deny the fact.”\\n\\n“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\\nbeyond my own party.”\\n\\n“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an\\nintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”\\n\\n“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still\\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend\\nhimself to strangers?”\\n\\n“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to\\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”\\n\\n“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,\\n“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\\nconcerns, as I often see done.”\\n\\n“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the\\nmasterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same\\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take\\nthe trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers\\nas capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”\\n\\nDarcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your\\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\\nto Darcy,--\\n\\n“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have\\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his\\ncousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\\nDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\\n\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing\\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was\\nready to take them all home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\\nLady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her\\nhalf-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,\\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\\nDarcy only, entered the room.\\n\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his\\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\\nbe within.\\n\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\\nseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency\\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\\ndeparture, she observed,--\\n\\n“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”\\n\\n“Perfectly so, I thank you.”\\n\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short\\npause, added,--\\n\\n“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\\nreturning to Netherfield again?”\\n\\n“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\\nvery little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\\nincreasing.”\\n\\n“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\\nprinciple.”\\n\\n“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as\\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\\n\\nHe took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable\\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\\nCollins first came to Hunsford.”\\n\\n“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\nkindness on a more grateful object.”\\n\\n“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\\nthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a\\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”\\n\\n“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\\ndistance of her own family and friends.”\\n\\n“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”\\n\\n“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s\\njourney. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”\\n\\n“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\\nof the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins\\nwas settled _near_ her family.”\\n\\n“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--\\n\\n“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of\\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\\nthe present distance.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot\\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\\nbeen always at Longbourn.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--\\n\\n“Are you pleased with Kent?”\\n\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\\nand her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_\\nsurprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his\\nintruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,\\nwithout saying much to anybody, went away.\\n\\n[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was\\ngone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\\nhave called on us in this familiar way.”\\n\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\\neven to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various\\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\\nthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\\nalways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former\\nfavourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there\\nwas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\n\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult\\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\\nFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\\nlove, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\\nseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at\\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.\\n\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would\\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\n\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he\\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: “On looking up”]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to\\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,\\nthat it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like\\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was\\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\nrencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her\\npleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of\\nRosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her\\na little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\npales opposite the Parsonage.\\n\\nShe was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\\nwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\\nshe saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\\nPutting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--\\n\\n“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\\n\\n“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally\\ndo every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.\\nAre you going much farther?”\\n\\n“No, I should have turned in a moment.”\\n\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\\ntogether.\\n\\n“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\\n\\n“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\\narranges the business just as he pleases.”\\n\\n“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\\ngreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\\n\\n“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\\nmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\\ndependence.”\\n\\n“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\\neither. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\\nwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\\n\\n“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\\nweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\\nwhere they like.”\\n\\n“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\\ndo.”\\n\\n“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in\\nmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\\nmoney.”\\n\\n“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the\\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is\\nthe usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”\\n\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\\nshe soon afterwards said,--\\n\\n“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\\nhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\\nfor the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\\nlikes with her.”\\n\\n“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must\\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\\n\\n“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\\nyour charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\\na little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\\nmay like to have her own way.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\\n\\n“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\\n\\n“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\\n\\n“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\\n\\n“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me\\nin our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\\nto him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\\nthat Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\\n\\n“What is it you mean?”\\n\\n“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.”\\n\\n“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\\n\\n“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\\nparticulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\\n\\n“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”\\n\\n“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\\nlady.”\\n\\n“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\\n\\n“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\\nonly told me what I have now told you.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\\nwas so thoughtful.\\n\\n“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\\ncousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\\njudge?”\\n\\n“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\\n\\n“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\\nfriend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”\\nshe continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\\nthat there was much affection in the case.”\\n\\n“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is\\nlessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\\n\\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\\nMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\\nmatters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\\ntaken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\\nhad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\\narrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\\n_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\\nin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\\ninflicted.\\n\\n“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel\\nFitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her\\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\\nbusiness in London.\\n\\n“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\\nobjection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\\nanything be urged against my father, who, though with some\\npeculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\\nand respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought\\nof her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would\\nnot allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\nthe want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want\\nof sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\\nretaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\n\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a\\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\\nmuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s\\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\\nkeener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to\\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\\nand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\n\\nShe could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his\\ncousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\\nthat he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not\\nmean to be unhappy about him.\\n\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\\ndoor-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But\\nthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\\nroom. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\\nthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\\nin an agitated manner, and thus began:--\\n\\n“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\\nyou.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\\nfollowed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\\nheart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\\ntenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\\ndegradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\\nto inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\\nsuit.\\n\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\\nthe compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did\\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\\nreceive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\\nall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\\nall his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\\nhis hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\\nfavourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\\ncountenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\\nexasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\\nand she said,--\\n\\n“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\\nfelt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\\nanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\\nof short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\\novercoming it after this explanation.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\\nhis mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\\ndreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\\n\\n“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\\nmight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\\n\\n“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\\nof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\\nother provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\\nthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?”\\n\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\\ncontinued,--\\n\\n“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\\nof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\\nworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\\nkind.”\\n\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n\\n“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\\n\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\\nkinder than towards myself.”\\n\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n\\n“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\\nis founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\\n\\n“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n\\n“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\\ninterest in him?”\\n\\n“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.”\\n\\n“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\\nreduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\\nhave withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\\nfor him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\\nindependence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\\nall this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\\ncontempt and ridicule.”\\n\\n“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\\n“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\\nthank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\\nwalk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\\nbeing impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\\nreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\\nCould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\nconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\\n\\n“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\\ndeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\\nmore gentlemanlike manner.”\\n\\nShe saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\\n\\n“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.”\\n\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\\n\\n“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\\n\\n“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\\nwishes for your health and happiness.”\\n\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\\nthe next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\\nher mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\\nand, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\\nastonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\\nevery review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\\nMr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\\nso much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\\nmust appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\\nincredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\\nan affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\\nof what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\\nwhich he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not\\nattempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\\nattachment had for a moment excited.\\n\\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\\nCatherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\\nCharlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Hearing herself called”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\\nsurprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\\nshe turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\\npark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\\nof the gates into the ground.\\n\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\\nwalk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\\nwhich edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\\nMr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\\nnow near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\npronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\\nthough in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\\ntowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\\na letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\\ncomposure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\\nmeeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\\nthen, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\\nout of sight.\\n\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\\nquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\\nfrom Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\\n\\n“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\\nits containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\\noffers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\\nwhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\\ndemand it of your justice.\\n\\n“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\\nfrom your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\\npersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\\nto be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\\ntheir motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\\nto myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\\noffensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\\nbe obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\\nHertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\\npreferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\\nit was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\\napprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\\nin love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\\nyou, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\\ninformation, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\\na general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\\nevent, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\\nobserved my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\\nthat his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\\nin him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\\ncheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\\nregard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\\nthem by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\\nhere, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\\nsister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\\nby such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\\nunreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\\nyour sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\\nacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\\nwas not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\\nher indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\\ninvestigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\\nfears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\\nbelieved it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\\nMy objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\\nacknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\\nin my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\\nmy friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\\nwhich, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\\ninstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\\nimmediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\\nsituation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\ncomparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\\nuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\\noccasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\\nyou. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\\nand your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\\nconsolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\\nany share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\\nyou and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\\ndisposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\ninducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\\nfriend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\\nNetherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\\nremember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\\nnow to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\\nwith my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\\nsensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\\nshortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\\nwent--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\\nfriend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\\nearnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\\nhis determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\\nprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\\nI hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\\nbelieved her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\\nregard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\\ndependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\\nthat he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\\ngiven, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\\nhaving done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\\naffair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\\ncondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\\nyour sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\\nBingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\\nhave met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\\ndid not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\ndanger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\\ndone, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\\nnothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\\nsister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\\ngoverned me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\\nyet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\\naccusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\\nlaying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\\nhas _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\\nshall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\\nMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\\nthe management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\\nthe discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\\nto him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\\ntherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\\nafterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\\nalways poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\\ngive him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\\nyoung man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\\nhighest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\\nintended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\\nsince I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\\nvicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\\nguard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\\nobservation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\\nhad opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\\ncould not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\\nonly can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\\ncreated, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\\nhis real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\\ndied about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\\nlast so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\\npromote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\\nallow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\\none thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\\nwithin half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\\nthat, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\\nnot think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\\npecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\nbenefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\\nmust be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\\ninsufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\\nsincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\\nproposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\\nbusiness was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\\nchiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\\nnow free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\\ndissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\\ndecease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\\nhe applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\\ncircumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\\nwere exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\\nand was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\\nhim to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\\ndoubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\\nhardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\\nresisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\\nthe distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\\nhis abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\\nperiod, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\\nknow not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\\nnotice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\\nmyself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\\nto unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\\nyour secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\\nto the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\\nmyself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\\nestablishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\\nthe lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\\nWickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\\nacquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\\nmost unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\\nrecommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\\nstrong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\\npersuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\\nwas then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\\nherself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\\nelopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\\nand offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\\nacknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\\nacted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\\nexposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\\nand Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\\nchief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\\nthousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\\ncomplete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\\nwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\\ntowards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\\nfalsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\\nwondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\\neither. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\\nnot in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\\ntold you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\\nwhat could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\\nFitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\\nstill more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\\nunavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\\nyour abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you\\ncannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and\\nthat there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour\\nto find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\ncourse of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n\\n“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\\nits contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to\\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of\\nwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which\\nhardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing\\nwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\\nsense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s\\ninsensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the\\nreal, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any\\nwish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done\\nwhich satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all\\npride and insolence.\\n\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\\nshe read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,\\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings\\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!\\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had\\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter\\nwas unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she\\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly\\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\\nown words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to\\nthe will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\\nwas fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was\\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\\nother, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\\nnot err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the\\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions\\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\\nBut every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\\nrender Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\n\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\\nMr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\\nentrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the\\npersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Meeting accidentally in Town”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nhimself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,\\nshe had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and\\nmanner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone\\nfor those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what\\nMr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\\ncontinuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\\ninstantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could\\nremember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the\\nneighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\\nthe mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\\nmore continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed\\nbetween Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at\\nlast she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\\nFitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the\\ninformation of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose\\ncharacter she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost\\nresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness\\nof the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been\\nwell assured of his cousin’s corroboration.\\n\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\\nbetween Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.\\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\\nthe very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield\\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;\\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s\\ncharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\\nalways prevent his exposing the son.\\n\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His\\nattentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had\\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\\nand fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\\nof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\\nesteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\nsister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his\\nactions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\\nthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\\nas Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.\\n\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\\nprejudiced, absurd.\\n\\n“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on\\nmy discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\\nvanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this\\ndiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not\\nhave been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\\nfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\\nconcerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”\\n\\nFrom herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation\\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\\ngive in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious\\nof her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what\\nCharlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice\\nof his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\\nfervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\\ncomplacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\\nsensibility.\\n\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\nmentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense\\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\\nfor denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\\nthan on hers.\\n\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but\\nit could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that\\nJane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest\\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\\nhad ever known before.\\n\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\nvariety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and\\nreconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so\\nimportant, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at\\nlength return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing\\ncheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as\\nmust make her unfit for conversation.\\n\\nShe was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\\ncalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\\nleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\\ntill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in\\nmissing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\\nlonger an object. She could think only of her letter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“His parting obeisance”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having\\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very\\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\\nhastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,\\nimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\\nhaving them all to dine with her.\\n\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her\\nfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\\nLadyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how\\nwould she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused\\nherself.\\n\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure\\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody\\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\\nattached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!\\nThey were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear\\nColonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\\nseemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His\\nattachment to Rosings certainly increases.”\\n\\nMr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which\\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\n\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\\nspirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--\\n\\n“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\\nmay stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\\ncompany, I am sure.”\\n\\n“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied\\nElizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\\nnext Saturday.”\\n\\n“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\\nspare you for another fortnight.”\\n\\n“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Dawson”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will\\nstay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you\\nas far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and\\nas Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good\\nroom for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be\\ncool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\\nlarge.”\\n\\n“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\\noriginal plan.”\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the\\nworld to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.\\nDarcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am\\nglad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”\\n\\n“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\\n\\n“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\\nhave somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?\\nOh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\\nattended to.”\\n\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;\\nand as she did not answer them all herself attention was\\nnecessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a\\nmind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection\\nmust be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave\\nway to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a\\nsolitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of\\nunpleasant recollections.\\n\\nMr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\\nstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\\nshe was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly\\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she\\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\\nfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in\\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,\\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\nirritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always\\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for\\never.\\n\\nAnxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s\\nexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\\nheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to\\nhave been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\\ncould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\\ngrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\\nrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n\\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s\\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\\nseldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it\\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\n\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\\nher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\\nthere; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\\n\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\\nand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out\\nher hand to both.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The elevation of his feelings.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\\n\\n“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet\\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\\nit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know\\nhow little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\\nmanner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we\\nsee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\\nand that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending\\nyour time unpleasantly.”\\n\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had\\nspent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\\nCharlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel\\nthe obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling\\nsolemnity replied,--\\n\\n“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\ntime not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\\nfortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior\\nsociety, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of\\nvarying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that\\nyour Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation\\nwith regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of\\nextraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on\\nwhat a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In\\ntruth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this\\nhumble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\\n\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\\nand truth in a few short sentences.\\n\\n“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will\\nbe able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\\nas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\\nmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\\nthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\\nother.”\\n\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to\\nhave the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from\\nwhom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such\\nsociety! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently\\nregretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for\\ncompassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,\\nand all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\n\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\\nplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\\nMr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning\\nher with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed\\nher in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,\\nwhen he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\\nhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“They had forgotten to leave any message”\\n]\\n\\n“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects\\ndelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\\nwhile you have been here.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and\\nthe carriage drove off.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems\\nbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\\nhappened!”\\n\\n“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.\\n\\n“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\\nHow much I shall have to tell!”\\n\\nElizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”\\n\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\\nwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s\\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days.\\n\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\\nspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt\\nhad reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\\nLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\\n\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for\\nLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know\\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\\nto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\\nin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,\\nand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\\nrepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister\\nfurther.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “How nicely we are crammed in”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\\ntogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\\nand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was\\nto meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s\\npunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.\\nThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\\nin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\\ndressing a salad and cucumber.\\n\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\\nout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\\n“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”\\n\\n“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the\\nmoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing\\nher purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it\\nis very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\\npull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\\nbetter.”\\n\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\nunconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\\nare going in a fortnight.”\\n\\n“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\n\\n“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\\ntake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,\\nand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\\ngo, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\\nhave!”\\n\\n“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\\nand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole\\ncampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\\nregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”\\n\\n“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to\\ntable. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about\\na certain person that we all like.”\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he\\nneed not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--\\n\\n“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\\nwaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\\nthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\\nmy news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\\nThere is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She\\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”\\n\\n“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\\nimprudent as to fortune.”\\n\\n“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\\n\\n“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.\\n\\n“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\\nthree straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled\\nthing?”\\n\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\ncoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\\nwas little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\\nliberal!\\n\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\nordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\\nboxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and\\nLydia’s purchases, were seated in it.\\n\\n“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my\\nbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now\\nlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\\nhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\\nsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\\nbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not\\nbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\\nget husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\\nCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\\nhow I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would\\n_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend\\nthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\\nevening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\ndressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a\\nlady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\\ndid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\\nForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”\\n\\nWith such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,\\nassisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.\\n\\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\\nin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth,----\\n\\n“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\\n\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\\nwhich occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the\\ntable, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet\\nwas doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\\nfashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\\nretailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\\nrather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various\\npleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\\n\\n“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\\nas we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\\nthere was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\\nKitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\\nbehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\\ncold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\\ntreated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\\nwe never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\\nAnd then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\\nloud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\\n\\nTo this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,\\nto depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the\\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\\n_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”\\n\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\n\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to\\nMeryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\\nthe scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\\nhome half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\\nanother reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham\\nagain, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to\\n_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond\\nexpression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped\\nthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n\\nShe had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\\nfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\\nlonger be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\\nin which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\\nshe related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\\nDarcy and herself.\\n\\nMiss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\\npartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\\nnatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\\nsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\\nunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.\\n\\n“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly\\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\\ndisappointment.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\\n\\n“Blame you! Oh, no.”\\n\\n“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\\n\\n“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\\n\\n“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\\nnext day.”\\n\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\\nas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,\\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\\ncollected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though\\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\\nseek to clear one, without involving the other.\\n\\n“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both\\nof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\\nwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\\nabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\\nDarcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”\\n\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n\\n“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so\\nvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,\\nonly consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and\\nwith the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a\\nthing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must\\nfeel it so.”\\n\\n“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full\\nof both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing\\nevery moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me\\nsaving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as\\nlight as a feather.”\\n\\n“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”\\n\\n“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\\nappearance of it.”\\n\\n“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\\nused to do.”\\n\\n“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an\\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing\\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”\\n\\n“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\\nthe matter as you do now.”\\n\\n“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very\\nuncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I\\nfelt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,\\nand vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”\\n\\n“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\\nundeserved.”\\n\\n“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is\\none point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand\\nWickham’s character.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no\\noccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”\\n\\n“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to\\nmake his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is\\nso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\\nMeryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to\\nit. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to\\nanybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found\\nout, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\\nAt present I will say nothing about it.”\\n\\n“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\\nre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”\\n\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She\\nhad got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a\\nfortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\\nmight wish to talk again of either. But there was still something\\nlurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not\\nrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister\\nhow sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in\\nwhich no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than\\na perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\\nthat very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be\\nable to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner\\nhimself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost\\nall its value!”\\n\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\\nstate of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\\nvery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in\\nlove before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from\\nher age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often\\nboast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to\\nevery other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those\\nregrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their\\ntranquillity.\\n\\n“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of\\nthis sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak\\nof it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I\\ncannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a\\nvery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\\neverybody, too, who is likely to know.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “I am determined never to speak of it again”\\n]\\n\\n“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”\\n\\n“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I\\nshall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was\\nher, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure\\nJane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\\nhas done.”\\n\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she\\nmade no answer.\\n\\n“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the\\nCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it\\nwill last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\\nexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,\\nshe is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\\nhousekeeping, I dare say.”\\n\\n“No, nothing at all.”\\n\\n“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will\\ntake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\\nfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\\ntalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it\\nquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”\\n\\n“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”\\n\\n“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they\\noften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\\nestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be\\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\\nthe last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in\\nthe neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\\nuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\\nand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\\nLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n\\n“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they\\noften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,\\nLizzy?”\\n\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\\nshe had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.\\n\\n“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel\\nMiller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”\\n\\n“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.\\n\\n“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\n“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”\\n\\n“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”\\n\\n“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”\\nadded Kitty.\\n\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\\nLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\\nof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s\\nobjections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\\ninterference in the views of his friend.\\n\\nBut the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\\nreceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the\\nregiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\\nvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour\\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\\ntheir _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\n\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\\nto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew\\nabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s\\ncongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\\nwhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate\\nin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n\\n“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”\\nsaid she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\\nher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\\nconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it\\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\\ngo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general\\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\\nbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--\\n\\n“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\\nexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\\ncircumstances.”\\n\\n“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to\\nus all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and\\nimprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\\nwould judge differently in the affair.”\\n\\n“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away\\nsome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\\nsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\\nare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows\\nwho have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”\\n\\n“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\\nof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\\nimportance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the\\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\\nLydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\\nwill be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\nthat ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\\nyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of\\nher mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty\\nis also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\nignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you\\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\\ndisgrace?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,\\naffectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--\\n\\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,\\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\\nsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\\nBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\\neven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\\nwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\\nthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\nmany degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest\\nof her life.”\\n\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\\nin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.\\nShe was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over\\nunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\\ndisposition.\\n\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\\nfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\\nunited volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\\nof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\\nShe saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at\\npresent unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\nand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\\nofficers at once.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Tenderly flirting”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nHad she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\\nsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\\nsame. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\\nmelancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there\\nhimself.\\n\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving\\nhome.\\n\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\\nan affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;\\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\\nand her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.\\n\\nOn the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,\\nwith others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\\ndisposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some\\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three\\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\\n\\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s\\nrecollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\\nasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\\nWith an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you\\nsay that he was at Rosings?”\\n\\n“Nearly three weeks.”\\n\\n“And you saw him frequently?”\\n\\n“Yes, almost every day.”\\n\\n“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\\n\\n“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray\\nmay I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in\\naddress that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his\\nordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more\\nserious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”\\n\\n“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much\\nwhat he ever was.”\\n\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\nrejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\\nand anxious attention, while she added,--\\n\\n“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,\\nfrom knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”\\n\\nWickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\\naccents,--\\n\\n“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\\nthe sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\\njudgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I\\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he\\nhas very much at heart.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\\nmutual desire of never meeting again.\\n\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\\nand impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there\\nwas every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous\\nhappiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\\nof her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nThe arrival of the\\nGardiners\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nHad Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\\nof good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of\\ndomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\\nimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often\\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as\\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\n\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\\nfather’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little\\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\\nabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\\nsister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around\\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\\nfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a\\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\\nhas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\\nforward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n\\n“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\\nsister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\\npleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\\nnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\\nthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\\n\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\\ncamp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\\nto be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\\ntoo full of lines under the words to be made public.\\n\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\ngood-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\\nwore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\\ncame back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\\nBennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\\nof June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton\\nwithout tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\\nhope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\\nreasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\\nsome cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\\nshould be quartered in Meryton.\\n\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\\napproaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\\npresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\n\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\\nand all was soon right again.\\n\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\\nowner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\\nand rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”\\n\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\\nbefore her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\\nMrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\\nmorning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\\nenjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\\nsuitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\\nand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\\ndisappointments abroad.\\n\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\\nlay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are\\nsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned that some\\nacquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\\nall the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\\nLambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\\nwas not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\\ninclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n\\n“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\\nmuch?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\\nacquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\\nknow.”\\n\\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\\nmust own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\\nshe really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\\nrichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\\ngrounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\\ncountry.”\\n\\nElizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such\\na risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.\\n\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\\nproprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\\nalarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\\nto the scheme.\\n\\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Conjecturing as to the date”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\n\\nElizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\\nevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\\nhalf a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\nwoody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\\nwonder at her being where she was.\\n\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\\nwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\\ndistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\\nit, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\\ntaking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\\nto be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\\nsuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\\nadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\\nfine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\\nfurniture of Rosings.\\n\\n“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\\nthese rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\\nherself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\\n\\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\\n\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\\nabsent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\\nreplied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\\nparty of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\\nnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\n\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\\nthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\\nminiatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\\nshe liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\\npicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\\nhad been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\\narmy,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\\nreturn it.\\n\\n“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\\n“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\\nother--about eight years ago.”\\n\\n“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\\nlooking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\\nus whether it is like or not.”\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\n\\n“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\nElizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\\n\\n“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\\n\\n“Yes, very handsome.”\\n\\n“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\\nmaster’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\\nbe then. He was very fond of them.”\\n\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\\nwhen she was only eight years old.\\n\\n“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.\\n\\n“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\naccomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\\nnew instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\\ncomes here to-morrow with him.”\\n\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\\nfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\\nmaster and his sister.\\n\\n“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\\n\\n“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\\n\\n“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\\n\\n“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\\ngood enough for him.”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\\n\\n“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\\nhim,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\\n“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\\never since he was four years old.”\\n\\nThis was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\\nHer keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\\ngrateful to her uncle for saying,--\\n\\n“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\\nhaving such a master.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\\nmeet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\\nwas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\\nworld.”\\n\\nElizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\\n\\n“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\\nas affable to the poor.”\\n\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\\nfurniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\\nmany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n\\n“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\\nlived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\\ngive him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\\nsaw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\\naway like other young men.”\\n\\n“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\\n\\n“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\\n\\n“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\\n\\n“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\\n\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\\ngive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\\nlast at Pemberley.\\n\\n“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\\none of the windows.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\\nthe room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\\ncan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\\nis nothing he would not do for her.”\\n\\nThe picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\\nDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\\nalso more intelligible.\\n\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\\nof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\\nwhen he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\\nearnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\\ngallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\\nfather’s lifetime.\\n\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\\nconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How\\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\\nor evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\\nthe housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\\nthe canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\\nherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\\nthan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\\nits impropriety of expression.\\n\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\\nthey returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\\n\\nAs they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\\nsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.\\n\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\\nof perfect civility.\\n\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\\nreturned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\\nuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\\nminutes in which they continued together were some of the most\\nuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\ninquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\\ndistraction of his thoughts.\\n\\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\\nleave.\\n\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\\nfeelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\\nvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\\nthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\\ndisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\\nshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\\nor, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\\ndiscrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\\nagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\\nstrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\\nfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\\nnever had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\\nWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\\nhe put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\\naccount for it.\\n\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\\nto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\nwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\\nher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\\ncomposure.\\n\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\n\\nThey entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\\nascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\\nof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\\nthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\\nmiles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\\ncircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\\nhanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\\nthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\\nthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\\nit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\\nabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\\nmet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\\nhe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\\nshe began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\\ngot beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\\nrecollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\\nher might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\\nno more.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\\nshe could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\\nacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\\nrevolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\\nshe, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\\nfashion.”\\n\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\\nconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\\nrelations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\\nhis taste, or his good manners.\\n\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\\nwalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\\nwonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\\ncompliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\\nextreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\\nwhat can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\\nthat his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\\nwork such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\\nme.”\\n\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\\nMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\\nElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\\nher husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\\ntogether. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\nvery unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\\nthe country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\\nwill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\\n\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\\nnot very differently engaged.\\n\\n“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\\npause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\\nduring your stay at Lambton?”\\n\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\\nmust be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\\nhim think really ill of her.\\n\\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\\nmile behind.\\n\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\\nthere seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\ngreat perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\\nand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\\n\\nOn Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\\nthe house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\\nparted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\\nwalking slowly towards the house.\\n\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\\n\\n“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\\n\\n“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\\naunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\\n_I_ have seen nothing of it.”\\n\\n“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\\n\\n“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\\nor rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\\nperfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\\ndisagreeable?”\\n\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\\nhim better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n\\n“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\\nher uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\\nat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\\nwarn me off his grounds.”\\n\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\\ngood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\\nmaster, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\\nevery virtue.”\\n\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\\nWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\\nanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\\nintercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.\\n\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above\\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,\\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\\narrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the\\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\\ncurricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\\nlivery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\\nto her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\\na quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\\nElizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\\nat her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\\ndreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\\nher favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\n\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\\n\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\\nher beyond a monosyllable.\\n\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\\nwas sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\\n\\nThey had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\\nElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\\ninquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\\nlooked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\\neach with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from\\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\nit was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\\nevident enough.\\n\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom\\nshe endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.\\nBingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be\\npleased.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “To make herself agreeable to all”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a\\nlike manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No\\nlook appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing\\noccurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On\\nthis point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted\\na recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\\nsaying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He\\nobserved to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and\\nin a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long\\ntime since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could\\nreply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the\\n26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\\ngave them meaning.\\n\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but\\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general\\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\\nremoved from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her\\nthat the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,\\nhowever temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\\nday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the\\ngood opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would\\nhave been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,\\nbut to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\\ntheir last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the\\nchange was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could\\nhardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the\\ncompany of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could\\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\\nRosings.\\n\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose\\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\n\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\\non this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was\\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\\n\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\\nfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\\nthat the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\n\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\\n\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\\nthere was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\\noverlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\\nwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\\na change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\\nsuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\\nmeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,\\nshe esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\\n\\nIt had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very\\nday of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\\nbreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Engaged by the river”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had\\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\\nher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know\\nwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now\\nbe renewed.\\n\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,\\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\n\\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\\nLondon. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\\ninferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\\n\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and\\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\\nof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\\nfeared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\\nBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\\nthem round the table.\\n\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\\nregret that he came.\\n\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\\n\\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\\n\\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\\nDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\\nthat corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections\\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\\nfor the welfare of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\\nrecollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\n\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,\\nMiss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\\nperson, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her\\nbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\\ncould not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\\namiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\nrepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n\\n“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I\\nnever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\\nshould not have known her again.”\\n\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\\nsummer.\\n\\n“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.”\\n\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a\\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,--\\n\\n“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_\\na beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she\\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\\none time.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_\\nwas only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\\n\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\\nboth. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but\\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\\nbeginning the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\\nJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on\\nthe third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\\nit had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\n\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\\nuncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\\nthemselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been\\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--\\n\\n“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\\nlet us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\\nthankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\\nknow what I have written.”\\n\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n\\n“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\\nwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\\nhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short\\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\\nto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\\nno farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\\nhackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the\\nLondon road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\\ninquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\\nand Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\\npass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\\nbroke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\\nI am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any\\nblame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\\nmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\\ncircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\\nprivately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\\ncould form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,\\nwhich is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed\\nto depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\\nhopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\\nis really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\\nbetter, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\\nmy life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\\nsomething of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\\nover, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\\nhowever, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\\nagain to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\\nare such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\\nsoon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of\\nthe former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\\nto try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\\nhis excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\\nbest and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\\nagain to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and\\nassistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\\n\\n“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and\\nimpetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\\nenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s\\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\\nI must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\\nI have not an instant to lose.”\\n\\n“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\\n\\nElizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\\naccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\\nmistress home instantly.\\n\\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\\n“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\\n\\n“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by\\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\\n\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\\nsomething indistinctly of his\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “I have not an instant to lose”\\n]\\n\\nconcern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke\\nagain. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It\\ncannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her\\nfriends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.\\nWickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too\\nwell to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that\\ncan tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”\\n\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.\\n\\n“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_\\nmight have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained\\nsome part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had\\nhis character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,\\nall too late now.”\\n\\n“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it\\ncertain, absolutely certain?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\\nalmost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to\\nScotland.”\\n\\n“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”\\n\\n“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s\\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\\nnothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”\\n\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\n\\n“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what\\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!”\\n\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\\nwas sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\\nwonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up\\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--\\n\\n“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything\\nto plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\\nWould to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,\\nthat might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment\\nyou with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\\nlong as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”\\n\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\\nreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\\nonly one serious parting look, went away.\\n\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\n\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s\\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\\nbusiness. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\\nhope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\\nof all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\\nthat Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\\nprey.\\n\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\\nfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\\nfeel it!\\n\\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\\nimportance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\\nby the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\\nthe postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\\nbeen a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\\npromised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\\nby one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be\\ndone about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?”\\n\\n“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\\n_That_ is all settled.”\\n\\n“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\\nprepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\\ntruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\\n\\nBut wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\\nGardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “The first pleasing earnest of their welcome”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\\ndrove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\\nmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\\nsuch a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\\nnot adequate to the risk.”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n\\n“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\\nhim capable of it?”\\n\\n“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\\nI can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\\nhope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\\ncase?”\\n\\n“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.”\\n\\n“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\\nBarnet road.”\\n\\n“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”\\n\\n“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\\nfriend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending\\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\\ndo as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\\nsuch a matter.”\\n\\n“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,\\nas to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”\\n\\n“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\\ntears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such\\na point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\\nnay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\\nand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\\nflirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\\neverything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\\ngreater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\\nare naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\\n\\n“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\\nWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\\n\\n“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\\ntheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\\nas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\\n\\n“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n\\n“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\\nsuch forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\nreserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\\nmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\nher.”\\n\\n“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\\nand Jane seem so well to understand?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\\nignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire\\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\\napparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the\\nneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\\nwas settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\\nopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\\nconsequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\\nenough from my thoughts.”\\n\\n“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\\n\\n“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\\nthe first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\nwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\\n\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\\nthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could\\nfind no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\n\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\\nthe road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\\nto Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\\nexpectations.\\n\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\\nfaces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n\\nElizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\\nher mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\\n\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\\nheard of the fugitives.\\n\\n“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\\neverything will be well.”\\n\\n“Is my father in town?”\\n\\n“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\\n\\n“And have you heard from him often?”\\n\\n“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\\nagain, till he had something of importance to mention.”\\n\\n“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”\\n\\n“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\\nshaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\\nHeaven! are quite well.”\\n\\n“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\\nmust have gone through!”\\n\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\\nthe whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\n\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\\nhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\\nhowever, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’\\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\\nblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\\nerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.\\n\\n“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton\\nwith all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia\\nhad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\\nside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\\nbeen well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\\nthe charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\\nchild! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\nWickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\\nto become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\\nwe shall do.”\\n\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n\\n“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be\\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\\nmay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\\nlost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\\ntogether as to what is to be done.”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\\nwherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\\nafter they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\\nout of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\\nsuch spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my\\nheart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\\nLydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\\nfor she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\\nkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\\n\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\\nher hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till\\ndinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\\nhousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\\n\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\\noppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\\nbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\\nmost trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\\nbefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\\nfaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\\nin either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\\nwhich she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more\\nof fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\\nof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--\\n\\n“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\\neach other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\\n\\nThen perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\\n“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\\nlesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one\\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less\\nbrittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in\\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\\n\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to\\nmake any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\\nopportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to\\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\\nthe subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I\\nhave not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.”\\n\\n“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\\nespecially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\\ngrieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”\\n\\n“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\\n\\n“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am\\ninclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”\\n\\n“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\\n\\n“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a\\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in\\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter\\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\\nbeing in love with each other many weeks.”\\n\\n“But not before they went to Brighton?”\\n\\n“No, I believe not.”\\n\\n“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\\nknow his real character?”\\n\\n“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad\\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:\\nbut I hope this may be false.”\\n\\n“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\\nthis could not have happened!”\\n\\n“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.\\n\\n“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”\\n\\n“We acted with the best intentions.”\\n\\n“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his\\nwife?”\\n\\n“He brought it with him for us to see.”\\n\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\\nwere the contents:--\\n\\n     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */\\n\\n     “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\\n     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\\n     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\\n     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\\n     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without\\n     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at\\n     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the\\n     surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\\n     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for\\n     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my\\n     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will\\n     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\\n     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my\\n     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to\\n     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed\\n     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\\n     drink to our good journey.\\n\\n“Your affectionate friend,\\n\\n“LYDIA BENNET.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had\\nfinished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But\\nat least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.\\nWhatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a\\n_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”\\n\\n“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\\nsuch confusion!”\\n\\n“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who\\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\\n\\n“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to\\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much\\nas I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen\\nalmost took from me my faculties.”\\n\\n“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\\nupon yourself alone.”\\n\\n“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\\nfatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.\\nKitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of\\nrepose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on\\nTuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady\\nLucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if\\nthey could be of use to us.”\\n\\n“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she\\n_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too\\nlittle of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,\\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”\\n\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\\n\\n“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where\\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could\\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\\ngentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be\\nremarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\\nto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\\nother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\nout even so much as this.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     The Post\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\\ndilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\\nThey were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to\\nsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\\n\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\\ninformation of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,\\nto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to\\nthe great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\\nsecurity for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\\ndays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to\\nher nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\\ngreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\\nvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\\ncheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,\\nshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\\nthem.\\n\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\\nbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.\\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\\nappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\\nher sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still\\nless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now\\ncome, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\\nentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some\\nnews of them.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\\nletter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately\\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.\\nThat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\\nwithout gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\\ndetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\\ndid not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was\\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.\\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and\\npromised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this\\neffect:--\\n\\n“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\npossible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,\\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\\nknow in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there\\nwere anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such\\na clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any\\nother person.”\\n\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for\\nher authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any\\ninformation of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\\n\\nShe had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father\\nand mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,\\nhowever, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to\\ngive more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\n\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\\npart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was\\nthe first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,\\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every\\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\\n\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n     /* “My dear Sir, */\\n\\n     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\\n     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\n     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\n     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and\\n     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable\\n     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\\n     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\\n     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\\n     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\\n     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The\\n     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\\n     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\\n     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\\n     of behaviour in your\\n\\n     [Illustration:\\n\\n“To whom I have related the affair”\\n\\n     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n     daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,\\n     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,\\n     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally\\n     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an\\n     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in\\n     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by\\n     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\\n     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one\\n     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for\\n     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect\\n     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,\\n     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain\\n     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\\n     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,\\n     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off\\n     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\n     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\\n\\n“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from\\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up\\nany connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His\\nformer acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship\\nwith any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out\\nas likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own\\nfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\\nhis fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired\\nthat he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be\\nnecessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the\\ntown, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner\\ndid not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;\\nJane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\\nunexpected; I had not an idea of it.”\\n\\nMr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their\\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\\nspiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\\nhis brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and\\nleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\\nfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.\\n\\n“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he\\nwill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\\nand make him marry her, if he comes away?”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\\nand her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet\\ncame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\\njourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\\nDerbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.\\nHis name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\\nand the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of\\ntheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\\nElizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from\\nPemberley.\\n\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\\nfairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time\\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\\nLydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\\none sleepless night out of two.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\nphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the\\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\\naway; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\\nit.\\n\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say\\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\\nand I ought to feel it.”\\n\\n“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\\n\\n“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to\\nfall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\\nIt will pass away soon enough.”\\n\\n“Do you suppose them to be in London?”\\n\\n“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\\n\\n“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\\n\\n“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there\\nwill probably be of some duration.”\\n\\nThen, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no\\nill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,\\nconsidering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”\\n\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s\\ntea.\\n\\n“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an\\nelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\\nlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\\nI can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”\\n\\n“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\\n\\n“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,\\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and\\nyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house\\nagain, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely\\nprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are\\nnever to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten\\nminutes of every day in a rational manner.”\\n\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\n\\n“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good\\ngirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\\nthem.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\\ncoming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their\\nmother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,\\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,\\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”\\n\\n“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”\\n\\n“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know\\nthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\\nthis half hour, and master has had a letter.”\\n\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They\\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\\nlibrary;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\\nseeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the\\nbutler, who said,--\\n\\n“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the\\nlittle copse.”\\n\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,\\nand ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\\npursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\\n\\nJane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as\\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out,--\\n\\n“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”\\n\\n“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”\\n\\n“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from\\nhis pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”\\n\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\n\\n“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is\\nabout.”\\n\\n     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */\\n\\n“My dear Brother,\\n\\n     “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\\n     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after\\n     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what\\n     part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.\\n     It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them\\n     both----”\\n\\n     [Illustration:\\n\\n“But perhaps you would like to read it”\\n\\n     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n     “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!”\\n\\n     Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,\\n     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are\\n     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\n     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\\n     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\n     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your\\n     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\n     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your\\n     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,\\n     considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as\\n     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\\n     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\\n     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s\\n     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\\n     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\\n     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are\\n     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\\n     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\\n     in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will\\n     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\\n     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming\\n     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on\\n     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,\\n     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my\\n     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\\n     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\\n     anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.\\n\\n“EDW. GARDINER.”\\n\\n“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be\\npossible that he will marry her?”\\n\\n“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her\\nsister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”\\n\\n“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.\\n\\n“No; but it must be done soon.”\\n\\nMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\\nwrote.\\n\\n“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.\\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.”\\n\\n“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”\\n\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\\n\\n“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be\\ncomplied with.”\\n\\n“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\\n\\n“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\\nare two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money\\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever\\nto pay him.”\\n\\n“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\\n\\n“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight\\na temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\\ngone.”\\n\\n“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me\\nbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,\\nit must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\\ndistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”\\n\\n“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\\nless than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\\nin the very beginning of our relationship.”\\n\\n“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\\nrepaid?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued\\nsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the\\nlibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\\n\\n“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\\nwere by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be\\nthankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\\nand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”\\n\\n“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would\\nnot marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\\nuncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\\nthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\\nof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\\npounds?”\\n\\n“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said\\nElizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\\nexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\\nnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\\nrequited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\\nprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\\nyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\\nshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\\nfirst sees my aunt!”\\n\\n“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said\\nJane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry\\nher is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\\nthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.”\\n\\n“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor\\nI, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”\\n\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\\nit known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly\\nreplied,--\\n\\n“Just as you please.”\\n\\n“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\\n\\n“Take whatever you like, and get away.”\\n\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs\\ntogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\\nwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\\nthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\\nsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,\\nher joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she\\nhad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\\nwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\\nfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n\\n“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will\\nbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My\\ngood, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\\neverything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\\nmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\\nLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”\\n\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\\nGardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.\\n\\n“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great\\nmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\\nassist Mr. Wickham with money.”\\n\\n“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but\\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\\never had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\\nIn a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\\nit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you\\nwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\\n\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,\\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\n\\n“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\\nLady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\\nairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\\nanything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\\nall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”\\n\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s\\nsituation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she\\nhad need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,\\nneither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly\\nexpected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only\\ntwo hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The spiteful old ladies”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of\\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\\nbe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\\n\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\n\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\\nBennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he\\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her\\nhusband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\nincome.\\n\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\\nthrough her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\\nthat sum.\\n\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\\nas little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\\ndespatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\\nits execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\\nindebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any\\nmessage to her.\\n\\nThe good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\\nfarm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\\nin this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\\nwas considered certain.\\n\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\\nher wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\\nproper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\nimportance.\\n\\n“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\\ntoo far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\\nPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\\n\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\\nimprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”\\n\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\\nclothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\\ntook place.\\n\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\\nspot.\\n\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\\nbut at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\\nfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\\ndisadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\\nseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\\nobjection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\\nkind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\\n\\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\\nshould meet.\\n\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\\nhave been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\\nthere must be a triumph.\\n\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\n\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\\nfamily.\\n\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\\ncould not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\\na couple who were only brought together because their passions were\\nstronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\\non quitting the militia.\\n\\n“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his\\nmarriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\\nconsidering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his\\naccount and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\\nRegulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\\nable and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\\nensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is\\nan advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\\nwritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\\nin and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\\npledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\\na list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\\nall will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\nGardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\\nleaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\\nyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.\\n\\n“E. GARDINER.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\\nremoval from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\\nMrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in\\nthe north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.\\n\\n“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking\\nto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\\nlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s\\nregiment.”\\n\\nHis daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\nadmitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,\\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who\\nagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\\nurged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show\\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to\\nthe north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon\\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth\\nwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;\\nand, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\\nwould have been the last object of her wishes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“With an affectionate smile”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTheir sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\\nprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\\nthem at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\\nwas dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who\\ngave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\\nbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\\nmust endure.\\n\\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive\\nthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\\nanxious, uneasy.\\n\\nLydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\\nWickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\\nalacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.\\n\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\\nenough to provoke him.\\n\\nElizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\\nLydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\\nfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\\nlength they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\\nsome little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\\ngreat while since she had been there.\\n\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\\nwere always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\\nhad not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\\ndown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\\nimpudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\\ncolour.\\n\\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\\nElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\\nwith a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\\nvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\\nthe world.\\n\\n“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:\\nit seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things\\nenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.”\\n\\nHer father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked\\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--\\n\\n“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was\\nafraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,\\nso I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass\\nnext to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the\\nwindow frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and\\nsmiled like anything.”\\n\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;\\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\\nthe dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to\\nher eldest sister,--\\n\\n“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a\\nmarried woman.”\\n\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\\ntheir other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by\\neach of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring\\nand boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n\\n“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\\nbreakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\\ncharming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they\\nmay have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the\\nplace to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”\\n\\n“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t\\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”\\n\\n“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.\\nYou and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at\\nNewcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I\\nwill take care to get good partners for them all.”\\n\\n“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\\n\\n“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\\nwinter is over.”\\n\\n“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not\\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.”\\n\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\\nshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\\nthink than such as did not.\\n\\nWickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to\\nfind it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her\\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather\\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\\nof having a companion.\\n\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did\\neverything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds\\non the first of September than anybody else in the country.\\n\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--\\n\\n“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\\nnot by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\\ncurious to hear how it was managed?”\\n\\n“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little\\nsaid on the subject.”\\n\\n“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\\no’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\\nwere to meet us at the church.\\n\\n“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\\nyou know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\\nhave gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\\ndressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\\nthinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\\nhe would be married in his blue coat.\\n\\n“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\\n\\n“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was\\ncalled away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\\nfrightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\\nand if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\\nluckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\\nout. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\\ngoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as\\nwell.”\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n\\n“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\\nI quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”\\n\\n“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\\nask you no questions.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\\nall, and then Wickham would be so angry.”\\n\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\\npower, by running away.\\n\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\\nwas impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\\nsister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\nLydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\\nintended.\\n\\n“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to\\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\\nspeaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\\nignorance.”\\n\\n“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the\\nletter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\\nout.”\\n\\nJane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\\nit:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“I am sure she did not listen.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\\nsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than\\nhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\\ncontain a denial.\\n\\n     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */\\n\\n“My dear Niece,\\n\\n     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\n     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\\n     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\\n     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\\n     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_\\n     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\\n     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing\\n     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\\n     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\\n     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\\n     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\\n     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\\n     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\\n     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\\n     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\n     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\n     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\n     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\\n     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\\n     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\\n     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\\n     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\\n     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\\n     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\\n     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\\n     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\\n     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\\n     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\\n     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\\n     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\\n     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\\n     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\\n     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\\n     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\\n     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\\n     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\\n     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\\n     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\\n     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\\n     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\\n     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\\n     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\\n     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\\n     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\\n     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\\n     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\\n     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\\n     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\\n     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\\n     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\\n     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\\n     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\\n     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\\n     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\\n     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\\n     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\\n     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\\n     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\\n     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\\n     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\\n     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\\n     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\\n     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\\n     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\\n     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\\n     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\\n     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\\n     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\\n     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\\n     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\\n     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\\n     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\\n     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\\n     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\\n     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\\n     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\\n     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\\n     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\\n     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\\n     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\n     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\\n     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\\n     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\\n     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\\n     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\\n     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\\n     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\\n     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\\n     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\\n     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\\n     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\\n     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\\n     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\\n     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\\n     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\n     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\n     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\\n     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\\n     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\\n     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\\n     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\\n     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\\n     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\\n     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\\n     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\\n     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\\n     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\\n     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\\n     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\\n     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\\n     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\\n     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\\n     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\n     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\\n     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\\n     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\\n     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\\n     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\\n     in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He\\n     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\\n     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\\n     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\\n     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\\n     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\n     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\\n     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\\n     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\\n     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\\n     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\\n     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\\n     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The\\n     children have been wanting me this half hour.\\n\\n“Yours, very sincerely,\\n\\n“M. GARDINER.”\\n\\n\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\\nproduced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her\\nsister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of\\ngoodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\njust, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest\\nextent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\\non himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\\nresearch; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\\nmust abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently\\nmeet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always\\nmost wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\npronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\\nnor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it\\nwas a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt\\nthat even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his\\naffection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\\nWickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from\\nthe connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think\\nhow much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\nextraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\\nhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\\nit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\\nshe could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might\\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\nmaterially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\\nthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\\nreturn. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to\\nhim. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she\\nhad ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\\nhim! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that\\nin a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better\\nof himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\\nagain. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible\\nof some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly\\nboth she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence\\nsubsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nShe was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;\\nand, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by\\nWickham.\\n\\n“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,\\nas he joined her.\\n\\n“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow\\nthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”\\n\\n“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,\\nand now we are better.”\\n\\n“True. Are the others coming out?”\\n\\n“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.”\\n\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\n“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”\\n\\n“Yes, she did.”\\n\\n“And what did she say?”\\n\\n“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\\nmisrepresented.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--\\n\\n“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”\\n\\n“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\\nElizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this\\ntime of year.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”\\n\\n“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\\n\\n“And do you like her?”\\n\\n“Very much.”\\n\\n“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”\\n\\n“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\\n\\n“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\\n\\n“I do not recollect that we did.”\\n\\n“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most\\ndelightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in\\nevery respect.”\\n\\n“How should you have liked making sermons?”\\n\\n“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,\\nto be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the\\nretirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of\\nhappiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\\ncircumstance when you were in Kent?”\\n\\n“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”\\n\\n“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\\nfirst, you may remember.”\\n\\n“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so\\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\\nhad been compromised accordingly.”\\n\\n“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”\\n\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\\nto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,\\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--\\n\\n“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\\nquarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\\nmind.”\\n\\nShe held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy with him.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he\\nnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\\nby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\\nhad said enough to keep him quiet.\\n\\nThe day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was\\nforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\\nentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\\ncontinue at least a twelvemonth.\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\\n\\n“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\\n\\n“Write to me very often, my dear.”\\n\\n“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\\ndo.”\\n\\nMr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He\\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n\\n“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\\nthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\\nall. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\\n\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\\n\\n“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\\none’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”\\n\\n“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\\nElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\\nsingle.”\\n\\n“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\\nbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If\\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\\n\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\\narticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\\nsmiled, and shook her head, by turns.\\n\\n“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\\nPhilips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that\\nI care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\\nnever want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\nNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\\nis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\\na word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”\\n\\n“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\\nMeryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\\ncomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\\ngoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--\\n\\n“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\\n_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”\\n\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\\nthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\\nwithout it.\\n\\n“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\\nto a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\\n\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n\\n“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\\nwill wait on him, of course.”\\n\\n“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\\n\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\\nNetherfield.\\n\\n“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let\\nhim seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\\nagain.”\\n\\n“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\\non him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\\nhim.”\\n\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\nhusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\\n\\n“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\\nbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\\nsays. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\\n\\n“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\\nalways so much.”\\n\\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\\nand fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\\nthat must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\\nseeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\\nHertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\\npaddock, and ride towards the house.\\n\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\\nto the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\\nagain by her sister.\\n\\n“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\\n\\n“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\\nknow.”\\n\\n“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\\nhim before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”\\n\\n“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\\nMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.”\\n\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\\nmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\\nGardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\\nhim. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\\nand whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.\\n\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a\\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\\nwishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.\\n\\n“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\\nenough for expectation.”\\n\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\\nsister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\\ngentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\\nmother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\\n\\nBingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\\nher courtesy and address of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\\napplied.\\n\\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\\nwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\\nwas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\\nwith herself for being so.\\n\\n“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”\\n\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\\n\\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n\\n“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\n\\n“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\\nseen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\\nGeorge Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\\nIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\\nto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\\n\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\\nnot tell.\\n\\n“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\\ncontinued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\\nhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\\nknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\\nhis leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\\nThank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\\ndeserves.”\\n\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\\ncountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.\\n\\n“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\\n“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\\nBennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\\nmoments of such painful confusion.\\n\\n“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\\none or the other again!”\\n\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\\nhow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\\nlover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\\nfive minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\\nas handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\\nthat she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\\nLongbourn in a few days’ time.\\n\\n“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\\nus as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you\\nI was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your\\nengagement.”\\n\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\\nhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\\non whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\\nof one who had ten thousand a year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Jane happened to look round”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\\nor, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\\nwhich must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\\nher.\\n\\n“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\\n“did he come at all?”\\n\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n\\n“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\\nwas in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\\nno longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\\nno more about him.”\\n\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her\\nbetter satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.\\n\\n“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\\nseen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\\nacquaintance.”\\n\\n“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\\ntake care.”\\n\\n“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”\\n\\n“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\\nyou as ever.”\\n\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\\ngood-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\\nhad revived.\\n\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\\nsportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\\ndecided. He placed himself by her.\\n\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\\nalarm.\\n\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\\nthe family.\\n\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\\nthan the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\\ncame, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\\nchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n\\n“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\\never.”\\n\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her\\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--\\n\\n“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\\ndo we?”\\n\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\\nbeing so silly!\\n\\n“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”\\n\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--\\n\\n“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\\n\\n“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”\\n\\n“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\\n\\n“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\\nthese three weeks.”\\n\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\n\\nWhen the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\\nmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n\\n“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what\\nsay you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I\\nassure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\\na haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\\nLucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\\nwhat do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\\nat Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as\\ngood a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved\\ngirls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.”\\n]\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of\\nBingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at\\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n\\n“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The\\nparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\\nmay often meet again.”\\n\\nElizabeth smiled.\\n\\n“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\\nagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\\npleasing, than any other man.”\\n\\n“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and\\nare provoking me to it every moment.”\\n\\n“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in\\nothers! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\nacknowledge?”\\n\\n“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your\\nconfidante.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\\nten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n\\n“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\\n\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\\nwould give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\\nthem.\\n\\n“Can you come to-morrow?”\\n\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\\naccepted with alacrity.\\n\\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\\ndressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\\ndressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\\n\\n“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\\nLizzy’s hair.”\\n\\n“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\\nforwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”\\n\\n“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\\nwhere is your sash, my dear?”\\n\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\\nwithout one of her sisters.\\n\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\\ncustom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\\nKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\\n\\n“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--\\n\\n“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\\npremeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\\nfew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\\n\\n“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\n\\n“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\\nsoon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\\nmy dressing-room.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\nquietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\\ninto the drawing-room.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\\neverything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\\ndaughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\\naddition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\\nofficiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\\nforbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\\ndaughter.\\n\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\\nan engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\\nmeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\n\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\\nhappy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\\nconcurrence.\\n\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\\nmorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\\nor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\\neverybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\\nwrite, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\\nas the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\\nwanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\\n\\nBut on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\\nshe saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\\nmother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\\nperceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\\nif engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\\nthe faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\\nother, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\\n_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\\neither; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\\nBingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\\nwhispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\\npleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n\\n“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\\nwhy is not everybody as happy?”\\n\\nElizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\\nsaid, for the present.\\n\\n“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness?”\\n\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\\ncard-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.\\n\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.\\n\\n“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\\ncircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\\nhappiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”\\n\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\\nfather had been short and to the purpose.\\n\\n“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n\\n“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\\n\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\\nand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\\nbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\nhimself.\\n\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\\nMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\\nhow really happy he was.\\n\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\\nturned to his daughter and said,--\\n\\n“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\\n\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\ngoodness.\\n\\n“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\\nalways exceed your income.”\\n\\n“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\\nunpardonable in _me_.”\\n\\n“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\\nmore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\\nhappy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\\nthat you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\\never was seen!”\\n\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\\nfavourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\\n\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\\nhimself obliged to accept.\\n\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\\nwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\\nshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\\nseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\\nattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\n\\n“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\\nit possible.”\\n\\n“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\\nit?”\\n\\n“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to\\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\\ncan never be what we once were to each other.”\\n\\n“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\\n\\n“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\\nreally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\\nwould have prevented his coming down again?”\\n\\n“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\\nmodesty.”\\n\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities.\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference\\nof his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\\nher against him.\\n\\n“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried\\nJane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\\nabove them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\\nanother man for you!”\\n\\n“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”\\n\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\\nshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\\nneighbours in Meryton.\\n\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\\nworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\\nlawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\\nshrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\\nopen, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\\nother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\\nname to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\\nintroduction had been made.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\\nfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\\n\\n“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\nmother?”\\n\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n\\n“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”\\n\\n“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\\n“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\\nand my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”\\n\\n“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\\nshort silence.\\n\\n“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\\nassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\\n\\n“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\\nsummer: the windows are full west.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\\nadded,--\\n\\n“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\\nMrs. Collins well?”\\n\\n“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\\n\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\\nrefreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\\ndeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\\n\\n“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\\nwill favour me with your company.”\\n\\n“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\\n\\nElizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\\nattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\\ndecent-looking rooms, walked on.\\n\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\\nconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\\ndisagreeable.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“After a short survey”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\\nher face.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\\nmanner:--\\n\\n“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\\ncome.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n\\n“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account\\nfor the honour of seeing you here.”\\n\\n“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to\\nknow that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such\\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\\n_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\\nafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\\nwith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\\nso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”\\n\\n“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”\\n\\n“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\\ncoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\\nis in existence.”\\n\\n“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\\nreport is spread abroad?”\\n\\n“I never heard that it was.”\\n\\n“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”\\n\\n“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\\nmay ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”\\n\\n“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\\n\\n“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\\n\\n“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\\nmay have drawn him in.”\\n\\n“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\\n\\n“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\\n\\n“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\\nthis ever induce me to be explicit.”\\n\\n“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”\\n\\n“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\\nmake an offer to me.”\\n\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--\\n\\n“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the\\nunion; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be\\naccomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of\\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\\nthe family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\\nearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\\n\\n“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\\nother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\\nkept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\\nMiss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\\n\\n“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss\\nBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\\nby any of us.”\\n\\n“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.\\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\\nto repine.”\\n\\n“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I\\nbe dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s\\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\\n\\n“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;\\nbut it will have no effect on _me_.”\\n\\n“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,\\nhonourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on\\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide\\nthem?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\nconnections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall\\nnot be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\\nquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\\n\\n“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are\\nequal.”\\n\\n“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who\\nare your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\\ncondition.”\\n\\n“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does\\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\\n\\n“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”\\n\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\\nmoment’s deliberation,--\\n\\n“I am not.”\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n\\n“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”\\n\\n“I will make no promise of the kind.”\\n\\n“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\\nwill ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\\nassurance I require.”\\n\\n“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make\\n_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\\nme, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on\\nhis cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\\nwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\\nfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\\nI cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\\nmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the\\nsubject.”\\n\\n“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\nobjections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no\\nstranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous\\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a\\npatched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\\n_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\\nof his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of\\nwhat are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\\n\\n“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.\\n“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\\nthe house.”\\n\\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\\nback. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.\\n\\n“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\\n\\n“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”\\n\\n“You are then resolved to have him?”\\n\\n“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”\\n\\n“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”\\n\\n“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any\\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s\\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\\nthe scorn.”\\n\\n“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\\nshall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\\nreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”\\n\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of\\nthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--\\n\\n“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\\nmother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\nLadyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother\\nimpatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady\\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n\\n“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”\\n\\n“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\\nShe is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through\\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to\\nacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “But now it comes out”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\nElizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\\nhours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\\nLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\\nonly set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\\nlooked forward to as possible at some future time.\\n\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help\\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\\nprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\\napplication to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\nthat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\n\\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n\\n“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\\nfriend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand\\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\\nat all.”\\n\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\\nbeen, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same\\nkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and\\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\\n\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n\\n“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”\\n\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\\nher was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\\nconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might\\nbe from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\\nconsequent explanations.\\n\\nShe followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He\\nthen said,--\\n\\n“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\\ncontents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”\\n\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous\\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\\nherself, when her father continued,--\\n\\n“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the\\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”\\n\\n“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”\\n\\n“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with\\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says\\non that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus\\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,\\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\\nher eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate\\nmay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages\\nin this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\\n‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the\\nheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and\\nextensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn\\nmy cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a\\nprecipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,\\nyou will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,\\nLizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for\\ncautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly\\neye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\\nhis life! It is admirable!”\\n\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force\\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\\nlittle agreeable to her.\\n\\n“Are you not diverted?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”\\n\\n“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last\\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of\\nsome family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give\\nher consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my\\nduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.\\nCollins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad\\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\\na Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\\nChristian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear\\nCharlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,\\nLizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be\\n_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them\\nin our turn?”\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so\\nstrange!”\\n\\n“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_\\npointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any\\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\\n\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\\nrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she\\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by\\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but\\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of\\nhis seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The efforts of his aunt”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s\\nvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to\\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to\\noutstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\\ndesperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.\\n\\nThey walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon\\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\\nmoment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was\\nhigh, she immediately said,--\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving\\nrelief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\\nsister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to\\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\\nof my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”\\n\\n“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\\nand emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\\nwas so little to be trusted.”\\n\\n“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\\nsake of discovering them.”\\n\\n“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.\\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\\n_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\\nonly of _you_.”\\n\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\\nher companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\\naffections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence\\nme on this subject for ever.”\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\\nvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\\nso material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make\\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\\nhappiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\\nbeen able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\\nexpression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\\nthough she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection\\nevery moment more valuable.\\n\\nThey walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\\nto the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,\\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\\nher nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\\nLadyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n\\n“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that\\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”\\n\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of\\nmy _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\\nyour relations.”\\n\\n“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your\\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\\nto you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\\n\\n“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\\nevening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly\\nexamined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,\\nimproved in civility.”\\n\\n“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a\\nmore gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I\\nconfess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\\n\\n“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\\na way.”\\n\\n“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\\nway that would induce you to accept me.”\\n\\n“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”\\n\\nDarcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you\\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\\ncontents?”\\n\\nShe explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all\\nher former prejudices had been removed.\\n\\n“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,\\nespecially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power\\nof reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly\\nmake you hate me.”\\n\\n“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\\nchanged as that implies.”\\n\\n“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly\\ncalm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a\\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.”\\n\\n“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\\nof the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely\\ndifferent from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance\\nattending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my\\nphilosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\\npleasure.”\\n\\n“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\\nignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\\nintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\\nchild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\\ntemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\\nand conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\\nI was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\\n_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\\nmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\\nstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\\nowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\\nadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\\ndoubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\\n\\n“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\\n\\n“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\\nwishing, expecting my addresses.”\\n\\n“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”\\n\\n“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\\ntake a proper direction.”\\n\\n“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\\n\\n“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\\n\\n“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”\\n\\n“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\\nintroduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\\nan hour after I had seen you.”\\n\\nHe then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\\nhad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\\ncomprehend.\\n\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\\neach to be dwelt on farther.\\n\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\\nanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\\nit was time to be at home.\\n\\n“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which\\nintroduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with\\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\\nit.\\n\\n“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.\\n\\n“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\\n\\n“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And\\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\\nthe case.\\n\\n“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told\\nhim of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\\naffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\\nthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\\nfriend.\\n\\n“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him\\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”\\n\\n“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits\\nwhich I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”\\n\\n“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\\nhim.”\\n\\n“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\\nhis reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one\\nthing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\\nin any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\\nnow.”\\n\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and\\nit was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of\\nBingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\\ncontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\\nparted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Unable to utter a syllable”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question\\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\\nfrom all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\\nreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own\\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\n\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.\\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\\nthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one\\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\\n_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\\nfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\\n“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\\nyou shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”\\n\\n“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;\\nand I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I\\nam in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we\\nare engaged.”\\n\\nJane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\\nyou dislike him.”\\n\\n“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\\ndid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these\\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\\nremember it myself.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\\nseriously, assured her of its truth.\\n\\n“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried\\nJane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you\\ncertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\\nhappy with him?”\\n\\n“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\\nare to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\\nShall you like to have such a brother?”\\n\\n“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\\nto do?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\\ntell you all.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\\nafraid you will be angry.”\\n\\n“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\\nLet me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me\\nhow long you have loved him?”\\n\\n“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\\nbut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\\nat Pemberley.”\\n\\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\\nfurther to wish.\\n\\n“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I\\nalways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your\\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\\nof it to another, not to you.”\\n\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\\nher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\\nconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,\\nand half the night spent in conversation.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\\nmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\\nour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\\ncoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\\nother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s\\nway.”\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\\nepithet.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\\n\\n“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\\nnever seen the view.”\\n\\n“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”\\n\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\\ncuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\\nconsented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\\nsaying,--\\n\\n“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\ndisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\\nall for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\\nhim except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”\\n\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\\nasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\\napplication for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\ndisapprobation.\\n\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\\nMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\\nextreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\\nwants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\\n\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\n“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\\n\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\\nBut will they make you happy?”\\n\\n“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\\nindifference?”\\n\\n“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”\\n\\n“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.\\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\\nsuch terms.”\\n\\n“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\\nabout.”\\n\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\\nand, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\\nmonths’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\\nshe did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\\nmatch.\\n\\n“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\\nyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\\n\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\\n\\n“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\\nand economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have\\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\\n\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\\nMr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\\nat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\\nhalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\\nthe others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\\nwould come in time.\\n\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\\nand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\\nfor, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\\nutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\\ncomprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\\nwas for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\nlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n\\n“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\\nhave thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\\nyou will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\\ndear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\\nLord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”\\n\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\\nher mother followed her.\\n\\n“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten\\nthousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a\\nspecial licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.\\nBut, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond\\nof, that I may have it to-morrow.”\\n\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman\\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\\nher deference for his opinion.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\\nevery hour in his esteem.\\n\\n“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,\\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\\nas Jane’s.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The obsequious civility.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could\\nyou begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\\nyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\\nplace?”\\n\\n“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\\nlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\\nknew that I _had_ begun.”\\n\\n“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\\nto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be\\nsincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\\n\\n“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”\\n\\n“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and\\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\\namiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you\\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\\nin your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\\nand really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\\nreasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\\nof _that_ when they fall in love.”\\n\\n“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was\\nill at Netherfield?”\\n\\n“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it\\nby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\\nto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\\nbe; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling\\nto come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you\\nfirst called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?”\\n\\n“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”\\n\\n“But I was embarrassed.”\\n\\n“And so was I.”\\n\\n“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\\n\\n“A man who had felt less might.”\\n\\n“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\\n_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\\nyou _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of\\nthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too\\nmuch_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\\nsprings from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the\\nsubject? This will never do.”\\n\\n“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\\nCatherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\\nremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to\\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to\\nwait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,\\nand I was determined at once to know everything.”\\n\\n“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\\nfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\\nNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\\nor had you intended any more serious consequences?”\\n\\n“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\\nmight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to\\nmyself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and\\nif she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”\\n\\n“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to\\nbefall her?”\\n\\n“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to\\nbe done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done\\ndirectly.”\\n\\n“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and\\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But\\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”\\n\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy\\nhad been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s\\nlong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would\\nbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt\\nhad already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\\nfor your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the\\ntruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.\\nBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,\\nindulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly\\nerr. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more\\nthan you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to\\nthe Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the\\nponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the\\nhappiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so\\nbefore, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\\nonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that\\ncan be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\\nYours,” etc.\\n\\nMr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still\\ndifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return\\nfor his last.\\n\\n     /* “Dear Sir, */\\n\\n     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will\\n     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\\n     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\\n     more to give.\\n\\n“Yours sincerely,” etc.\\n\\nMiss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching\\nmarriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to\\nJane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former\\nprofessions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and\\nthough feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.\\n\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was\\nas sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were\\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\\nbeing loved by her sister.\\n\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\\nto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\\nsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that\\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\\nhusband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\\nmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did\\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his\\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s\\ngood-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be\\nvulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at\\nall likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to\\nkeep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might\\nconverse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\\narising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its\\npleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward\\nwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society so\\nlittle pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their\\nfamily party at Pemberley.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LXI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\\nrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she\\nafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be\\nguessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of\\nher children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,\\nit was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous\\nand invariably silly.\\n\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\\ndrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\n\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\\n_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\\nsisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\\nto Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\n\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\\ntemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she\\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\\nignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s\\nsociety she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\n\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite\\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,\\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\\nmuch reluctance.\\n\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\\nthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of\\neverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be\\nprevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The\\nletter was to this effect:--\\n\\n     /* “My dear Lizzy, */\\n\\n     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear\\n     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\\n     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\\n     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\\n     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\\n     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four\\n     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\\n     if you had rather not.\\n\\n“Yours,” etc.\\n\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in\\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\\nof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she\\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\\ndischarging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\\ncheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\\nfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\\nreputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\\nreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him\\nfurther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when\\nher husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the\\nBingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even\\nBingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\n\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she\\nthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\\ndropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\\nto Elizabeth.\\n\\nPemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters\\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\\nother, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\\nastonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of\\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\\npleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\\nher way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a\\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\n\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,\\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\\nand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n\\nWith the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,\\nas well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\\nsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\\nher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\\n\\n                            [Illustration:\\n\\n                                  THE\\n                                  END\\n                                   ]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n             CHISWICK PRESS:--CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO.\\n                  TOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON.\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate\\nwas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\\ntheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\\nrespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\\nsurrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\\nman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\\nlife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\\ndeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\\nalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and\\nreceived into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood,\\nthe legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he\\nintended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and\\ntheir children, the old Gentleman\\'s days were comfortably spent. His\\nattachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\\nMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\\ninterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\\ncomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\\nchildren added a relish to his existence.\\n\\nBy a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\\nlady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\\namply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\\nmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\\nwealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\\nso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\\nof what might arise to them from their father\\'s inheriting that\\nproperty, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\\nremaining moiety of his first wife\\'s fortune was also secured to her\\nchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.\\n\\nThe old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every\\nother will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\\nunjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but\\nhe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\\nbequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\\nand daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his\\nson\\'s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way,\\nas to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most\\ndear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the\\nestate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up\\nfor the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his\\nfather and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of\\nhis uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\\nof two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest\\ndesire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of\\nnoise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for\\nyears, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not\\nto be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three\\ngirls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper\\nwas cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many\\nyears, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the\\nproduce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\\nimprovement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\\nhis only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\\nthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained\\nfor his widow and daughters.\\n\\nHis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\\nDashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\\ncould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\\nfamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\\nsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\\nthem comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\nand Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there\\nmight prudently be in his power to do for them.\\n\\n[Illustration: _His son\\'s son, a child of four years old._]\\n\\nHe was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\\nand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\\nrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\\nhis ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might\\nhave been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have\\nbeen made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and\\nvery fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature\\nof himself; more narrow-minded and selfish.\\n\\nWhen he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\\nincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\\npounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The\\nprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mother\\'s fortune, warmed his\\nheart, and made him feel capable of generosity. \"Yes, he would give\\nthem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\\nbe enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he\\ncould spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\" He\\nthought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did\\nnot repent.\\n\\nNo sooner was his father\\'s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nwithout sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\\narrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her\\nright to come; the house was her husband\\'s from the moment of his\\nfather\\'s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\\ngreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s situation, with only common\\nfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing. But in _her_ mind there\\nwas a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any\\noffence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a\\nsource of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a\\nfavourite with any of her husband\\'s family; but she had had no\\nopportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little\\nattention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion\\nrequired it.\\n\\nSo acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\\nearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\\narrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\\nnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on\\nthe propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three\\nchildren determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid\\na breach with their brother.\\n\\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\\na strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\\nher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\\nenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\\nthat eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\\nto imprudence. She had an excellent heart; her disposition was\\naffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\\none of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor\\'s.\\nShe was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\\njoys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable,\\ninteresting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between\\nher and her mother was strikingly great.\\n\\nElinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister\\'s sensibility; but\\nby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each\\nother now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief\\nwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought\\nfor, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to\\ntheir sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection\\nthat could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation\\nin future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could\\nstruggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother,\\ncould receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with\\nproper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar\\nexertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.\\n\\nMargaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl;\\nbut as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne\\'s romance,\\nwithout having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\\nto equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\\nmother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.\\nAs such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\\nher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\nbeyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them,\\nwith some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no\\nplan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she\\ncould accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his\\ninvitation was accepted.\\n\\nA continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\\ndelight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness,\\nno temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\\ndegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness\\nitself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended\\nto do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\\nof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most\\ndreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How\\ncould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child\\ntoo, of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss\\nDashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she\\nconsidered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so\\nlarge an amount. It was very well known that no affection was ever\\nsupposed to exist between the children of any man by different\\nmarriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little\\nHarry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?\\n\\n\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied her husband, \"that I\\nshould assist his widow and daughters.\"\\n\\n\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he\\nwas light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he\\ncould not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away\\nhalf your fortune from your own child.\"\\n\\n\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only\\nrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their\\nsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it\\nwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could\\nhardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise,\\nI could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.\\nThe promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something\\nmust be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new\\nhome.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ something\\nneed not be three thousand pounds. Consider,\" she added, \"that when\\nthe money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will\\nmarry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored\\nto our poor little boy--\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely, \"that would make\\ngreat difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so\\nlarge a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for\\ninstance, it would be a very convenient addition.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it would.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were\\ndiminished one half. Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious\\nincrease to their fortunes!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so\\nmuch for his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters! And as it is--only\\nhalf blood! But you have such a generous spirit!\"\\n\\n\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied. \"One had rather,\\non such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can\\nthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can\\nhardly expect more.\"\\n\\n\"There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,\" said the lady, \"but we\\nare not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can\\nafford to do.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds\\na-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have\\nabout three thousand pounds on their mother\\'s death--a very\\ncomfortable fortune for any young woman.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no\\naddition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst\\nthem. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do\\nnot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of\\nten thousand pounds.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the\\nwhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother\\nwhile she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I\\nmean. My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\\nA hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\nHis wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this\\nplan.\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with fifteen\\nhundred pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live\\nfifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"\\n\\n\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that\\npurchase.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when\\nthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and\\nhealthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it\\ncomes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You\\nare not aware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the\\ntrouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of\\nthree to old superannuated servants by my father\\'s will, and it is\\namazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these\\nannuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting\\nit to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards\\nit turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her\\nincome was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it;\\nand it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money\\nwould have been entirely at my mother\\'s disposal, without any\\nrestriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities,\\nthat I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\\nall the world.\"\\n\\n\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood, \"to have\\nthose kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income. One\\'s fortune, as your\\nmother justly says, is _not_ one\\'s own. To be tied down to the regular\\npayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it\\ntakes away one\\'s independence.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think\\nthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises\\nno gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at\\nmy own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any\\nthing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a\\nhundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\\nbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\\nbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\\nwould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\\nincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\\nyear. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty\\npounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\\nmoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my\\nfather.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\\nmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\\nall. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\\nbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\\ncomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\\nand sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever\\nthey are in season. I\\'ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther;\\nindeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but\\nconsider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your\\nmother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven\\nthousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the\\ngirls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of\\ncourse, they will pay their mother for their board out of it.\\nAltogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what\\non earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so\\ncheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no\\ncarriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no\\ncompany, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only conceive how\\ncomfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot\\nimagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them\\nmore, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able\\nto give _you_ something.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you are perfectly right.\\nMy father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than\\nwhat you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you\\nhave described. When my mother removes into another house my services\\nshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little\\npresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood. \"But, however, _one_ thing\\nmust be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland,\\nthough the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and\\nlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will\\ntherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\\n\\n\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly. A valuable legacy\\nindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant\\naddition to our own stock here.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what\\nbelongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for\\nany place _they_ can ever afford to live in. But, however, so it is.\\nYour father thought only of _them_ And I must say this: that you owe\\nno particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we\\nvery well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything\\nin the world to _them._\"\\n\\nThis argument was irresistible. It gave to his intentions whatever of\\ndecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be\\nabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the\\nwidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts\\nas his own wife pointed out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any\\ndisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased\\nto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when\\nher spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other\\nexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy\\nremembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her\\ninquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for\\nto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could\\nhear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and\\nease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier\\njudgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which\\nher mother would have approved.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it._\"]\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise\\non the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last\\nearthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no\\nmore than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her\\ndaughters\\' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her\\nin affluence. For their brother\\'s sake, too, for the sake of his own\\nheart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to\\nhis merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His\\nattentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\\ntheir welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied\\non the liberality of his intentions.\\n\\nThe contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for\\nher daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge\\nof her character, which half a year\\'s residence in her family\\nafforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or\\nmaternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\\nhave found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a\\nparticular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility,\\naccording to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters\\'\\ncontinuance at Norland.\\n\\nThis circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and\\nthe brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentlemanlike and pleasing young\\nman, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister\\'s\\nestablishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of\\nhis time there.\\n\\nSome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of\\ninterest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died\\nvery rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,\\nfor, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the\\nwill of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either\\nconsideration. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\\nthat he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.\\nIt was contrary to every doctrine of her\\'s that difference of fortune\\nshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of\\ndisposition; and that Elinor\\'s merit should not be acknowledged by\\nevery one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\\n\\nEdward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any\\npeculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his\\nmanners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident\\nto do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.\\nHis understanding was good, and his education had given it solid\\nimprovement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to\\nanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\\ndistinguished as--they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a\\nfine figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to\\ninterest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to\\nsee him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John\\nDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these\\nsuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her\\nambition to see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for\\ngreat men or barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort\\nand the quiet of private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother\\nwho was more promising.\\n\\nEdward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged\\nmuch of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s attention; for she was, at that time, in such\\naffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw\\nonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He\\ndid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed\\nconversation. She was first called to observe and approve him farther,\\nby a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the\\ndifference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which\\nrecommended him most forcibly to her mother.\\n\\n\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.\\nIt implies everything amiable. I love him already.\"\\n\\n\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you know more of him.\"\\n\\n\"Like him!\" replied her mother with a smile. \"I feel no sentiment of\\napprobation inferior to love.\"\\n\\n\"You may esteem him.\"\\n\\n\"I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. Her manners\\nwere attaching, and soon banished his reserve. She speedily\\ncomprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor\\nperhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his\\nworth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all\\nher established ideas of what a young man\\'s address ought to be, was\\nno longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his\\ntemper affectionate.\\n\\nNo sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to\\nElinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and\\nlooked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.\\n\\n\"In a few months, my dear Marianne,\" said she, \"Elinor will, in all\\nprobability be settled for life. We shall miss her; but _she_ will be\\nhappy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?\"\\n\\n\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few\\nmiles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will\\ngain a brother--a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest\\nopinion in the world of Edward\\'s heart. But you look grave, Marianne;\\ndo you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it with some surprise.\\nEdward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet--he is not\\nthe kind of young man; there is something wanting--his figure is not\\nstriking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man\\nwho could seriously attach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit,\\nthat fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides\\nall this, I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste. Music seems\\nscarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor\\'s drawings very\\nmuch, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their\\nworth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while\\nshe draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter. He admires as\\na lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be\\nunited. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every\\npoint coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the\\nsame books, the same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how\\nspiritless, how tame was Edward\\'s manner in reading to us last night!\\nI felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much\\ncomposure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my\\nseat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost\\ndriven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such\\ndreadful indifference!\"\\n\\n\"He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant\\nprose. I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him Cowper.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow\\nfor difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she\\nmay overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke _my_\\nheart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\\nMama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I\\nshall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He\\nmust have all Edward\\'s virtues, and his person and manners must\\nornament his goodness with every possible charm.\"\\n\\n\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in\\nlife to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate\\nthan your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your\\ndestiny be different from her\\'s!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\n\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"that Edward should have\\nno taste for drawing.\"\\n\\n\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should you think so? He\\ndoes not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the\\nperformances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means\\ndeficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of\\nimproving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he\\nwould have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such\\nmatters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on\\nany picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste,\\nwhich in general direct him perfectly right.\"\\n\\nMarianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but\\nthe kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by\\nthe drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous\\ndelight, which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet,\\nthough smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister\\nfor that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.\\n\\n\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not consider him as\\ndeficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,\\nfor your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were\\nyour opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\\n\\nMarianne hardly knew what to say. She would not wound the feelings of\\nher sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was\\nimpossible. At length she replied:\\n\\n\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing\\nequal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many\\nopportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his\\ninclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion\\nin the world of his goodness and sense. I think him every thing that\\nis worthy and amiable.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile, \"that his dearest friends\\ncould not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not\\nperceive how you could express yourself more warmly.\"\\n\\nMarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\\n\\n\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor, \"no one can, I\\nthink, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in\\nunreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his\\nprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps\\nhim silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.\\nBut of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from\\npeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I\\nhave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been\\nwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I\\nhave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard\\nhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\\nI venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of\\nbooks exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just\\nand correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every\\nrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\\nAt first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person\\ncan hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which\\nare uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is\\nperceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really\\nhandsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?\"\\n\\n\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When\\nyou tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection\\nin his face, than I now do in his heart.\"\\n\\nElinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she\\nhad been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood\\nvery high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but\\nshe required greater certainty of it to make Marianne\\'s conviction of\\ntheir attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her\\nmother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,\\nto wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain\\nthe real state of the case to her sister.\\n\\n\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think very highly of\\nhim--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"\\n\\nMarianne here burst forth with indignation--\\n\\n\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than\\ncold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I\\nwill leave the room this moment.\"\\n\\nElinor could not help laughing. \"Excuse me,\" said she; \"and be assured\\nthat I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my\\nown feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;\\nbelieve them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\\nsuspicion--the hope--of his affection for me may warrant, without\\nimprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am\\nby no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments when the\\nextent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known,\\nyou cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own\\npartiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I\\nfeel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other\\npoints to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from\\nbeing independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from\\nFanny\\'s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never\\nbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if\\nEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in\\nhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a\\ngreat fortune or high rank.\"\\n\\nMarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother\\nand herself had outstripped the truth.\\n\\n\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she. \"Yet it certainly\\nsoon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I\\nshall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity\\nof improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\\nbe so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he\\nshould be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw\\nhimself, how delightful it would be!\"\\n\\nElinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not\\nconsider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as\\nMarianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about\\nhim which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something\\nalmost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel\\nit, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to\\nproduce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more\\nreasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which\\nforbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother\\nneither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present,\\nnor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself,\\nwithout strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With\\nsuch a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on\\nthe subject. She was far from depending on that result of his\\npreference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as\\ncertain. Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed\\nthe nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes,\\nshe believed it to be no more than friendship.\\n\\nBut, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when\\nperceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time,\\n(which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first\\nopportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking\\nto her so expressively of her brother\\'s great expectations, of Mrs.\\nFerrars\\'s resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the\\ndanger attending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in_, that\\nMrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to\\nbe calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and\\ninstantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the\\ninconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor\\nshould not be exposed another week to such insinuations.\\n\\nIn this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the\\npost, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the\\noffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of\\nher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The\\nletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\\nof friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a\\ndwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a\\ncottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she\\nmight think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly\\npressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to\\ncome with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own\\nresidence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton\\nCottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any\\nalteration, be made comfortable to her. He seemed really anxious to\\naccommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so\\nfriendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin;\\nmore especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and\\nunfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for\\ndeliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The\\nsituation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as\\nDevonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a\\nsufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to\\nthe place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood\\nof Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a\\nblessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her\\ndaughter-in-law\\'s guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved\\nplace would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a\\nwoman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her\\nacknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\\nand then hastened to show both letters to her daughters, that she\\nmight be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.\\n\\nElinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle\\nat some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present\\nacquaintance. On _that_ head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\\nher mother\\'s intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as\\ndescribed by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so\\nuncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either\\npoint; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any\\ncharm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of\\nNorland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother\\nfrom sending a letter of acquiescence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nNo sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged\\nherself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife\\nthat she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no\\nlonger than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They\\nheard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her\\nhusband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.\\nShe had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into\\nDevonshire. Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and,\\nin a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to\\nher, repeated, \"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from\\nhence! And to what part of it?\" She explained the situation. It was\\nwithin four miles northward of Exeter.\\n\\n\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope to see many of my\\nfriends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends\\nfind no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will\\nfind none in accommodating them.\"\\n\\nShe concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John\\nDashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still\\ngreater affection. Though her late conversation with her\\ndaughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer\\nthan was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her\\nin that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and\\nElinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to\\nshow Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother,\\nhow totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly\\nsorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from\\nNorland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her\\nfurniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for\\nthe very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his\\npromise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.\\nThe furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of\\nhousehold linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte\\nof Marianne\\'s. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh:\\nshe could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood\\'s income\\nwould be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any\\nhandsome article of furniture.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready\\nfurnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty\\narose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the\\ndisposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future\\nhousehold, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was\\nexceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested\\nher, was soon done. The horses which were left her by her husband had\\nbeen sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of\\ndisposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the\\nearnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her\\nchildren, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept\\nit; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. _Her_ wisdom too limited\\nthe number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom\\nthey were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their\\nestablishment at Norland.\\n\\nThe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into\\nDevonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress\\'s arrival; for as\\nLady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred\\ngoing directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and\\nshe relied so undoubtingly on Sir John\\'s description of the house, as\\nto feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her\\nown. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from\\ndiminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the\\nprospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted\\nto be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.\\nNow was the time when her son-in-law\\'s promise to his father might\\nwith particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do\\nit on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be\\nlooked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs.\\nDashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be\\nconvinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his\\nassistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months\\nat Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of\\nhousekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man\\nof any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to,\\nthat he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to\\nhave any design of giving money away.\\n\\nIn a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton\\'s\\nfirst letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their\\nfuture abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin\\ntheir journey.\\n\\nMany were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so\\nmuch beloved. \"Dear, dear Norland!\" said Marianne, as she wandered\\nalone before the house, on the last evening of their being there;\\n\"when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home\\nelsewhere! Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now\\nviewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no\\nmore! And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.\\nNo leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become\\nmotionless although we can observe you no longer! No; you will\\ncontinue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you\\noccasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your\\nshade! But who will remain to enjoy you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nThe first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a\\ndisposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they\\ndrew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a\\ncountry which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a\\nview of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It\\nwas a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After\\nwinding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A\\nsmall green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat\\nwicket gate admitted them into it.\\n\\nAs a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;\\nbut as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the\\nroof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were\\nthe walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly\\nthrough the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance\\nwas a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were\\nthe offices and the stairs. Four bedrooms and two garrets formed the\\nrest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good\\nrepair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but\\nthe tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house\\nwere soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on\\ntheir arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear\\nhappy. It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from\\nfirst seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they\\nreceived an impression in its favour which was of material service in\\nrecommending it to their lasting approbation.\\n\\nThe situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately\\nbehind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open\\ndowns, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was\\nchiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the\\ncottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it\\ncommanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country\\nbeyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley\\nin that direction; under another name, and in another course, it\\nbranched out again between two of the steepest of them.\\n\\nWith the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the\\nwhole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered\\nmany additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was\\na delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to\\nsupply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. \"As\\nfor the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is too small for our\\nfamily, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the\\npresent, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in\\nthe spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\\nthink about building. These parlors are both too small for such\\nparties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I\\nhave some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with\\nperhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other\\nfor an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily\\nadded, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\\nlittle cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must\\nnot expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult\\nmatter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the\\nworld in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"\\n\\nIn the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the\\nsavings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never\\nsaved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the\\nhouse as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their\\nparticular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and\\nother possessions, to form themselves a home. Marianne\\'s pianoforte\\nwas unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor\\'s drawings were\\naffixed to the walls of their sitting room.\\n\\nIn such employments as these they were interrupted soon after\\nbreakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called\\nto welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from\\nhis own house and garden in which theirs might at present be\\ndeficient. Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He\\nhad formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young\\ncousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured;\\nand his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their\\narrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to\\nbe an object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest\\ndesire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and\\npressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they\\nwere better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\\nto a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give\\noffence. His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour\\nafter he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit\\narrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by\\na present of game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their\\nletters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the\\nsatisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day.\\n\\nLady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her\\nintention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured\\nthat her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was\\nanswered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced\\nto them the next day.\\n\\n[Illustration: _So shy before company._]\\n\\nThey were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of\\ntheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her\\nappearance was favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more\\nthan six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall\\nand striking, and her address graceful. Her manners had all the\\nelegance which her husband\\'s wanted. But they would have been improved\\nby some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long\\nenough to detract something from their first admiration, by showing\\nthat, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had\\nnothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or\\nremark.\\n\\nConversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and\\nLady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her\\ntheir eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which\\nmeans there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in\\ncase of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire\\nhis beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him,\\nwhile he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise\\nof her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as\\nhe could make noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child\\nought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the\\npresent case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were\\nmost like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled\\neither, for of course every body differed, and every body was\\nastonished at the opinion of the others.\\n\\nAn opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on\\nthe rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house\\nwithout securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nBarton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had\\npassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from\\ntheir view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large\\nand handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\\nand elegance. The former was for Sir John\\'s gratification, the latter\\nfor that of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends\\nstaying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every\\nkind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to\\nthe happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward\\nbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of\\ntalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with\\nsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a\\nsportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she\\nhumoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady\\nMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all\\nthe year round, while Sir John\\'s independent employments were in\\nexistence only half the time. Continual engagements at home and\\nabroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and\\neducation; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise\\nto the good breeding of his wife.\\n\\nLady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of\\nall her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her\\ngreatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John\\'s\\nsatisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting\\nabout him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier\\nthey were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the\\njuvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever\\nforming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in\\nwinter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who\\nwas not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen.\\n\\nThe arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy\\nto him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants\\nhe had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were\\nyoung, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good\\nopinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to\\nmake her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his\\ndisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation\\nmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In\\nshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\nof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his\\ncottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,\\nthough he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is\\nnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a\\nresidence within his own manor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by\\nSir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;\\nand as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young\\nladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day\\nbefore, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They\\nwould see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a\\nparticular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither\\nvery young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness\\nof the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.\\nHe had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring\\nsome addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was\\nfull of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton\\'s mother had arrived at\\nBarton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable\\nwoman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as\\nthey might imagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were\\nperfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and\\nwished for no more.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton\\'s mother, was a good-humoured, merry,\\nfat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and\\nrather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner\\nwas over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and\\nhusbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was\\nvexed at it for her sister\\'s sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor\\nto see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave\\nElinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery\\nas Mrs. Jennings\\'s.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by\\nresemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be\\nhis wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton\\'s mother. He was\\nsilent and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite\\nof his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old\\nbachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though\\nhis face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his\\naddress was particularly gentlemanlike.\\n\\nThere was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as\\ncompanions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton\\nwas so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity\\nof Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his\\nmother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to\\nenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after\\ndinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to\\nevery kind of discourse except what related to themselves.\\n\\nIn the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was\\ninvited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to\\nbe charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went\\nthrough the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into\\nthe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in\\nthe same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated\\nthat event by giving up music, although by her mother\\'s account, she\\nhad played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s performance was highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his\\nadmiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation\\nwith the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently\\ncalled him to order, wondered how any one\\'s attention could be\\ndiverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a\\nparticular song which Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon\\nalone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He paid\\nher only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him\\non the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their\\nshameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not\\nto that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,\\nwas estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of\\nthe others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five\\nand thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every\\nexquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every\\nallowance for the colonel\\'s advanced state of life which humanity\\nrequired.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She had only two\\ndaughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and\\nshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the\\nworld. In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as\\nfar as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting\\nweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She was\\nremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the\\nadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady\\nby insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of\\ndiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to\\npronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne\\nDashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening\\nof their being together, from his listening so attentively while she\\nsang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons\\'\\ndining at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to\\nher again. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would\\nbe an excellent match, for _he_ was rich, and _she_ was handsome. Mrs.\\nJennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever\\nsince her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty\\ngirl.\\n\\nThe immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for\\nit supplied her with endless jokes against them both. At the park she\\nlaughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former\\nher raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\\nperfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first\\nincomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew\\nwhether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,\\nfor she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel\\'s\\nadvanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than\\nherself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy\\nof her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability\\nof wishing to throw ridicule on his age.\\n\\n\"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,\\nthough you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon\\nis certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be\\n_my_ father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must\\nhave long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous!\\nWhen is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not\\nprotect him?\"\\n\\n\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can\\neasily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my\\nmother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use\\nof his limbs!\"\\n\\n\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the\\ncommonest infirmity of declining life?\"\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing, \"at this rate you must\\nbe in continual terror of _my_ decay; and it must seem to you a\\nmiracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.\"\\n\\n\"Mamma, you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel\\nBrandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of\\nlosing him in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer.\\nBut thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had better not have\\nany thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any\\nchance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I\\nshould not think Colonel Brandon\\'s being thirty-five any objection to\\nhis marrying _her_ .\"\\n\\n\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne, after pausing a moment,\\n\"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be\\nuncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might\\nbring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the\\nprovision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman\\ntherefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of\\nconvenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be\\nno marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem\\nonly a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at\\nthe expense of the other.\"\\n\\n\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor, \"to convince you\\nthat a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five\\nanything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to\\nher. But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to\\nthe constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced\\nto complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic\\nfeel in one of his shoulders.\"\\n\\n\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne; \"and with me a\\nflannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,\\nrheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and\\nthe feeble.\"\\n\\n\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him\\nhalf so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to\\nyou in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"\\n\\nSoon after this, upon Elinor\\'s leaving the room, \"Mamma,\" said\\nMarianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot\\nconceal from you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now\\nbeen here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come. Nothing but\\nreal indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay. What else\\ncan detain him at Norland?\"\\n\\n\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\" said Mrs. Dashwood. \"I had\\nnone. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the\\nsubject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want\\nof pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of\\nhis coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?\"\\n\\n\"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.\"\\n\\n\"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her\\nyesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed-chamber, she\\nobserved that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not\\nlikely that the room would be wanted for some time.\"\\n\\n\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of\\ntheir behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how\\ncomposed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the\\nlast evening of their being together! In Edward\\'s farewell there was\\nno distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an\\naffectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely\\ntogether in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most\\nunaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting\\nNorland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is\\ninvariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to\\navoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to\\nthemselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding\\nthem, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had\\ngiven to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far\\ngreater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss\\nof their father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for\\nthe first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much\\noccupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them\\nalways employed.\\n\\nTheir visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in\\nspite of Sir John\\'s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the\\nneighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at\\ntheir service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s spirit overcame the\\nwish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to\\nvisit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who\\ncould be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.\\nAbout a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding\\nvalley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly\\ndescribed, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered\\nan ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a\\nlittle of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to\\nbe better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its\\npossessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately\\ntoo infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.\\n\\nThe whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high\\ndowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to\\nseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy\\nalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their\\nsuperior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and\\nMargaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the\\npartial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the\\nconfinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had\\noccasioned. The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others\\nfrom their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne\\'s declaration\\nthat the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud\\nwould be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off\\ntogether.\\n\\nThey gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at\\nevery glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the\\nanimating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears\\nwhich had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such\\ndelightful sensations.\\n\\n\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne, \"superior to\\nthis?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.\"\\n\\nMargaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind,\\nresisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer,\\nwhen suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain\\nset full in their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged,\\nthough unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their\\nown house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the\\nexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,--it was that of\\nrunning with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which\\nled immediately to their garden gate.\\n\\nThey set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step\\nbrought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop\\nherself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached\\nthe bottom in safety.\\n\\nA gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was\\npassing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her\\naccident happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She\\nhad raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in\\nher fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered\\nhis services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her\\nsituation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther\\ndelay, and carried her down the hill. Then passing through the garden,\\nthe gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly\\ninto the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his\\nhold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.\\n\\nElinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and\\nwhile the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a\\nsecret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he\\napologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so\\nfrank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome,\\nreceived additional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been\\neven old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs.\\nDashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child;\\nbut the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to\\nthe action which came home to her feelings.\\n\\nShe thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address\\nwhich always attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he\\ndeclined, as he was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know\\nto whom she was obliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his\\npresent home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him\\nthe honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The\\nhonour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself\\nstill more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.\\n\\nHis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the\\ntheme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\\nagainst Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\\nattractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his person than the\\nrest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting\\nher up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their\\nentering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the\\nadmiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her\\npraise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\\nfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\\nhouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\\nthought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every\\ncircumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his\\nresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\\nof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her\\nimagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a\\nsprained ankle was disregarded.\\n\\nSir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather\\nthat morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne\\'s accident\\nbeing related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any\\ngentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\\n\\n\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is _he_ in the country? That is\\ngood news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on\\nThursday.\"\\n\\n\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\\n\\n\"Know him! to be sure I do. Why, he is down here every year.\"\\n\\n\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\\n\\n\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent\\nshot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.\"\\n\\n\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne, indignantly.\\n\"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his\\npursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\\n\\nSir John was rather puzzled.\\n\\n\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him as to all\\n_that._ But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the\\nnicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she out with\\nhim today?\"\\n\\nBut Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.\\nWilloughby\\'s pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his\\nmind.\\n\\n\"But who is he?\" said Elinor. \"Where does he come from? Has he a house\\nat Allenham?\"\\n\\nOn this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he\\ntold them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the\\ncountry; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady\\nat Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he\\nwas to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I\\ncan tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own\\nin Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up\\nto my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss\\nMarianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will\\nbe jealous, if she does not take care.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,\\n\"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of\\n_my_ daughters towards what you call _catching him._ It is not an\\nemployment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with\\nus, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what\\nyou say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose\\nacquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\\n\\n\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,\" repeated\\nSir John. \"I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he\\ndanced from eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\\n\\n\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, \"and with\\nelegance, with spirit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\\n\\n\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever\\nbe his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and\\nleave him no sense of fatigue.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see how it will\\nbe. You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor\\nBrandon.\"\\n\\n\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne, warmly, \"which I\\nparticularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit\\nis intended; and \\'setting one\\'s cap at a man,\\' or \\'making a conquest,\\'\\nare the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and\\nif their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago\\ndestroyed all its ingenuity.\"\\n\\nSir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as\\nheartily as if he did, and then replied--\\n\\n\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.\\nPoor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth\\nsetting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling\\nabout and spraining of ankles.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nMarianne\\'s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,\\nstyled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to\\nmake his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with\\nmore than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John\\'s account of him\\nand her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the\\nvisit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,\\nand domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced\\nhim. Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview\\nto be convinced.\\n\\nMiss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a\\nremarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form,\\nthough not so correct as her sister\\'s, in having the advantage of\\nheight, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in\\nthe common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was\\nless violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown,\\nbut, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant;\\nher features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in\\nher eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an\\neagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From\\nWilloughby their expression was at first held back, by the\\nembarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. But\\nwhen this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw\\nthat to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united\\nfrankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\\nthat of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such\\na look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to\\nherself for the rest of his stay.\\n\\nIt was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her\\nto talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and\\nshe had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily\\ndiscovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and\\nthat it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that\\nrelated to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his\\nopinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her\\nfavourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so\\nrapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have\\nbeen insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the\\nexcellence of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was\\nstrikingly alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by\\neach; or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no\\nlonger than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her\\neyes could be displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught\\nall her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they\\nconversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\\n\\n\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, \"for _one_\\nmorning I think you have done pretty well. You have already\\nascertained Mr. Willoughby\\'s opinion in almost every matter of\\nimportance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are\\ncertain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have\\nreceived every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\\nBut how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\\nextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon\\nhave exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to\\nexplain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages,\\nand then you can have nothing farther to ask.\"\\n\\n\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so\\nscanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too\\nhappy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of\\ndecorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been\\nreserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful:--had I talked only of the\\nweather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this\\nreproach would have been spared.\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended with Elinor--she\\nwas only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of\\nwishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new\\nfriend.\" Marianne was softened in a moment.\\n\\nWilloughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their\\nacquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He\\ncame to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his\\nexcuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day\\ngave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had\\nceased to be possible, by Marianne\\'s perfect recovery. She was\\nconfined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement\\nbeen less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick\\nimagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was\\nexactly formed to engage Marianne\\'s heart, for with all this, he\\njoined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind\\nwhich was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and\\nwhich recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\\n\\nHis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,\\nthey talked, they sang together; his musical talents were\\nconsiderable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which\\nEdward had unfortunately wanted.\\n\\nIn Mrs. Dashwood\\'s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne\\'s;\\nand Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he\\nstrongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too\\nmuch what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons\\nor circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other\\npeople, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of\\nundivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too\\neasily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution\\nwhich Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne\\ncould say in its support.\\n\\nMarianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized\\nher at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her\\nideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was\\nall that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every\\nbrighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour\\ndeclared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities\\nwere strong.\\n\\n[Illustration: _They sang together._]\\n\\nHer mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their\\nmarriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before\\nthe end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate\\nherself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and\\nWilloughby.\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s partiality for Marianne, which had so\\nearly been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to\\nElinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit\\nwere drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the\\nother had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his\\nfeelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to\\nsensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that\\nthe sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own\\nsatisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that\\nhowever a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might\\nforward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking\\nopposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel\\nBrandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five\\nand thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty?\\nand as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him\\nindifferent. She liked him--in spite of his gravity and reserve, she\\nbeheld in him an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were\\nmild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of\\nspirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped\\nhints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief\\nof his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and\\ncompassion.\\n\\nPerhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted\\nby Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being\\nneither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\\n\\n\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby one day, when they\\nwere talking of him together, \"whom every body speaks well of, and\\nnobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody\\nremembers to talk to.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it is injustice in\\nboth of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and\\nI never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.\"\\n\\n\"That he is patronised by _you_,\" replied Willoughby, \"is certainly in\\nhis favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in\\nitself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a\\nwoman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the\\nindifference of any body else?\"\\n\\n\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will\\nmake amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their\\npraise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more\\nundiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\\n\\n\"In defence of your _protÈgÈ_ you can even be saucy.\"\\n\\n\"My _protÈgÈ_, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will\\nalways have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between\\nthirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been\\nabroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of\\ngiving me much information on various subjects; and he has always\\nanswered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good\\nnature.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously, \"he has told you,\\nthat in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are\\ntroublesome.\"\\n\\n\"He _would_ have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such\\ninquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been\\npreviously informed.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may have extended to the\\nexistence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.\"\\n\\n\"I may venture to say that _his_ observations have stretched much\\nfurther than _your_ candour. But why should you dislike him?\"\\n\\n\"I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very\\nrespectable man, who has every body\\'s good word, and nobody\\'s notice;\\nwho, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to\\nemploy, and two new coats every year.\"\\n\\n\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has neither genius, taste,\\nnor spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no\\nardour, and his voice no expression.\"\\n\\n\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\" replied Elinor,\\n\"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the\\ncommendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and\\ninsipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,\\nwell-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an\\namiable heart.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using me unkindly. You\\nare endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my\\nwill. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be\\nartful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel\\nBrandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he\\nhas found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade\\nhim to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you,\\nhowever, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other\\nrespects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for\\nan acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me\\nthe privilege of disliking him as much as ever.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nLittle had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first\\ncame into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy\\ntheir time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have\\nsuch frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them\\nlittle leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When\\nMarianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad,\\nwhich Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution.\\nThe private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water\\nwere made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.\\nIn every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and\\nfamiliarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly\\ncalculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\\nDashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of\\nMarianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\\nin her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her\\naffection.\\n\\nElinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished\\nthat it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to\\nsuggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne\\nabhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend\\nunreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in\\nthemselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary\\neffort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and\\nmistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\\nall times, was an illustration of their opinions.\\n\\nWhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he\\ndid, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at\\nthe park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the\\nrest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the\\namusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when\\nobliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand\\ntogether and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made\\nthem of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not\\nshame, and seemed hardly to provoke them.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left\\nher no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her\\nit was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young\\nand ardent mind.\\n\\nThis was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to\\nWilloughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with\\nher from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought\\nit possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her\\npresent home.\\n\\nElinor\\'s happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at\\nease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded\\nher no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,\\nnor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than\\never. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the\\nconversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting\\ntalker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which\\nensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated\\nher own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor\\'s memory\\nbeen equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very\\nearly in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings\\'s last\\nillness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.\\nLady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more\\nsilent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve\\nwas a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.\\nTowards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and\\nintimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She had\\nnothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her\\ninsipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same;\\nand though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband,\\nprovided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest\\nchildren attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment\\nfrom them than she might have experienced in sitting at home; and so\\nlittle did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any\\nshare in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of\\nher being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\\n\\nIn Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find\\na person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities,\\nexcite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.\\nWilloughby was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even\\nher sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his\\nattentions were wholly Marianne\\'s, and a far less agreeable man might\\nhave been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for\\nhimself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in\\nconversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\\nindifference of her sister.\\n\\nElinor\\'s compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect\\nthat the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\\nThis suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from\\nhim one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by\\nmutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on\\nMarianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint\\nsmile, \"Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second\\nattachments.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\\n\\n\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.\"\\n\\n\"I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on\\nthe character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know\\nnot. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable\\nbasis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy\\nto define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.\"\\n\\n\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied; \"and yet there is\\nsomething so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is\\nsorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor. \"There are\\ninconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne\\'s, which all the\\ncharms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her\\nsystems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at\\nnought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look\\nforward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying--\\n\\n\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a\\nsecond attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those\\nwho have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the\\ninconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be\\nequally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiÊ of her principles.\\nI only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second\\nattachment\\'s being pardonable.\"\\n\\n\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\\nsentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic\\nrefinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently\\nare they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\\ndangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper\\nand mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like\\nher, but who from an enforced change--from a series of unfortunate\\ncircumstances--\" Here he stopped suddenly; appeared to think that he\\nhad said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\\nwhich might not otherwise have entered Elinor\\'s head. The lady would\\nprobably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss\\nDashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it\\nwas, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion\\nwith the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more.\\nBut Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. The whole\\nstory would have been speedily formed under her active imagination;\\nand every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous\\nlove.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nAs Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the\\nlatter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of\\nall that she knew before of Marianne\\'s imprudence and want of thought,\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her,\\nwith the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one\\nthat he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was\\nnot in her mother\\'s plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter\\nher resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the\\nservant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\\nto receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and\\ntold her sister of it in raptures.\\n\\n\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,\"\\nshe added, \"and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall\\nshare its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the\\ndelight of a gallop on some of these downs.\"\\n\\nMost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to\\ncomprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for\\nsome time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,\\nthe expense would be a trifle; Mamma she was sure would never object\\nto it; and any horse would do for _him_; he might always get one at\\nthe park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor\\nthen ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present\\nfrom a man so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too\\nmuch.\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly, \"in supposing I know very\\nlittle of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much\\nbetter acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the\\nworld, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is\\nto determine intimacy; it is disposition alone. Seven years would be\\ninsufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\\ndays are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of\\ngreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from\\nWilloughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together\\nfor years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her\\nsister\\'s temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach\\nher the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for\\nher mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\nmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she\\nconsented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly\\nsubdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent\\nkindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw\\nhim next, that it must be declined.\\n\\nShe was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the\\ncottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to\\nhim in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his\\npresent. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time\\nrelated, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side\\nimpossible. His concern however was very apparent; and after\\nexpressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice, \"But,\\nMarianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I\\nshall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to\\nform your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall\\nreceive you.\"\\n\\nThis was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the\\nsentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her\\nsister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so\\ndecided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between\\nthem. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each\\nother; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she,\\nor any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to\\ndiscover it by accident.\\n\\nMargaret related something to her the next day, which placed this\\nmatter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding\\nevening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the\\nparlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for\\nobservations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to\\nher eldest sister, when they were next by themselves.\\n\\n\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to tell you about\\nMarianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"\\n\\n\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every day since they first\\nmet on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I\\nbelieve, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round\\nher neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great\\nuncle.\"\\n\\n\"But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be\\nmarried very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.\"\\n\\n\"Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of\\n_his_.\"\\n\\n\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne\\'s. I am almost sure it is, for I\\nsaw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out\\nof the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as\\ncould be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently\\nhe took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it\\nwas all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a\\npiece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.\"\\n\\nFor such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not\\nwithhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance\\nwas in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.\\n\\nMargaret\\'s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory\\nto her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the\\npark, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor\\'s particular\\nfavourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\\nMargaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, \"I must not\\ntell, may I, Elinor?\"\\n\\nThis of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.\\nBut the effort was painful. She was convinced that Margaret had fixed\\non a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a\\nstanding joke with Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\n[Illustration: _He cut off a long lock of her hair._]\\n\\nMarianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good\\nto the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to\\nMargaret--\\n\\n\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to\\nrepeat them.\"\\n\\n\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret; \"it was you\\nwho told me of it yourself.\"\\n\\nThis increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly\\npressed to say something more.\\n\\n\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\" said Mrs.\\nJennings. \"What is the gentleman\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"I must not tell, ma\\'am. But I know very well what it is; and I know\\nwhere he is too.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be\\nsure. He is the curate of the parish I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, _that_ he is not. He is of no profession at all.\"\\n\\n\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth, \"you know that all this\\nis an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in\\nexistence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such\\na man once, and his name begins with an F.\"\\n\\nMost grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this\\nmoment, \"that it rained very hard,\" though she believed the\\ninterruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her\\nladyship\\'s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as\\ndelighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was\\nimmediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion\\nmindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of\\nrain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked\\nMarianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of\\ndifferent people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so\\neasily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.\\n\\nA party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see\\na very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a\\nbrother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not\\nbe seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict\\norders on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,\\nand Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be\\nallowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit\\nthem, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years. They\\ncontained a noble piece of water--a sail on which was to a form a\\ngreat part of the morning\\'s amusement; cold provisions were to be\\ntaken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted\\nin the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\\n\\nTo some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,\\nconsidering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the\\nlast fortnight; and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was\\npersuaded by Elinor to stay at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nTheir intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from\\nwhat Elinor had expected. She was prepared to be wet through,\\nfatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate,\\nfor they did not go at all.\\n\\nBy ten o\\'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they\\nwere to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had\\nrained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\\nand the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and\\ngood humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the\\ngreatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.\\n\\nWhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the\\nrest there was one for Colonel Brandon:--he took it, looked at the\\ndirection, changed colour, and immediately left the room.\\n\\n\"What is the matter with Brandon?\" said Sir John.\\n\\nNobody could tell.\\n\\n\"I hope he has had no bad news,\" said Lady Middleton. \"It must be\\nsomething extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my\\nbreakfast table so suddenly.\"\\n\\nIn about five minutes he returned.\\n\\n\"No bad news, Colonel, I hope;\" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he\\nentered the room.\\n\\n\"None at all, ma\\'am, I thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is\\nworse.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.\"\\n\\n\"But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a\\nletter of business? Come, come, this won\\'t do, Colonel; so let us hear\\nthe truth of it.\"\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" said Lady Middleton, \"recollect what you are saying.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?\" said\\nMrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter\\'s reproof.\\n\\n\"No, indeed, it is not.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well.\"\\n\\n\"Whom do you mean, ma\\'am?\" said he, colouring a little.\\n\\n\"Oh! you know who I mean.\"\\n\\n\"I am particularly sorry, ma\\'am,\" said he, addressing Lady Middleton,\\n\"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which\\nrequires my immediate attendance in town.\"\\n\\n\"In town!\" cried Mrs. Jennings. \"What can you have to do in town at\\nthis time of year?\"\\n\\n\"My own loss is great,\" he continued, \"in being obliged to leave so\\nagreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence\\nis necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.\"\\n\\nWhat a blow upon them all was this!\\n\\n\"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,\" said\\nMarianne, eagerly, \"will it not be sufficient?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n\"We must go,\" said Sir John. \"It shall not be put off when we are so\\nnear it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to\\ndelay my journey for one day!\"\\n\\n\"If you would but let us know what your business is,\" said Mrs.\\nJennings, \"we might see whether it could be put off or not.\"\\n\\n\"You would not be six hours later,\" said Willoughby, \"if you were to\\ndefer your journey till our return.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot afford to lose _one_ hour.\"\\n\\nElinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, \"There\\nare some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of\\nthem. He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this\\ntrick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was\\nof his own writing.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" replied Marianne.\\n\\n\"There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of\\nold,\" said Sir John, \"when once you are determined on anything. But,\\nhowever, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the\\ntwo Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked\\nup from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his\\nusual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.\"\\n\\nColonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of\\ndisappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be\\nunavoidable.\\n\\n\"Well, then, when will you come back again?\"\\n\\n\"I hope we shall see you at Barton,\" added her ladyship, \"as soon as\\nyou can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to\\nWhitwell till you return.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in\\nmy power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! he must and shall come back,\" cried Sir John. \"If he is not here\\nby the end of the week, I shall go after him.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, so do, Sir John,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"and then perhaps you may\\nfind out what his business is.\"\\n\\n\"I do not want to pry into other men\\'s concerns. I suppose it is\\nsomething he is ashamed of.\"\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s horses were announced.\\n\\n\"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?\" added Sir John.\\n\\n\"No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you\\nhad better change your mind.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you it is not in my power.\"\\n\\nHe then took leave of the whole party.\\n\\n\"Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this\\nwinter, Miss Dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid, none at all.\"\\n\\n\"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to\\ndo.\"\\n\\nTo Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\\n\\n\"Come Colonel,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"before you go, do let us know\\nwhat you are going about.\"\\n\\nHe wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the\\nroom.\\n\\nThe complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto\\nrestrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and\\nagain how provoking it was to be so disappointed.\\n\\n\"I can guess what his business is, however,\" said Mrs. Jennings\\nexultingly.\\n\\n\"Can you, ma\\'am?\" said almost every body.\\n\\n\"Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"And who is Miss Williams?\" asked Marianne.\\n\\n\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have\\nheard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel\\'s, my dear; a\\nvery near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the\\nyoung ladies.\" Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\\n\"She is his natural daughter.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel\\nwill leave her all his fortune.\"\\n\\nWhen Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret\\non so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as\\nthey were all got together, they must do something by way of being\\nhappy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although\\nhappiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a\\ntolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The\\ncarriages were then ordered; Willoughby\\'s was first, and Marianne\\nnever looked happier than when she got into it. He drove through the\\npark very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of\\nthem was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the\\nreturn of all the rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive;\\nbut said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while\\nthe others went on the downs.\\n\\nIt was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that\\nevery body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the\\nCareys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down\\nnearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great\\ncontentment. Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder\\nMiss Dashwoods. Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor\\'s right hand; and they had\\nnot been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and\\nsaid to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, \"I have found you\\nout in spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.\"\\n\\nMarianne coloured, and replied very hastily, \"Where, pray?\"\\n\\n\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had been out in my\\ncurricle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined\\nto find out _where_ you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss\\nMarianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,\\nI hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when\\nI was there six years ago.\"\\n\\nMarianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed\\nheartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they\\nhad been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.\\nWilloughby\\'s groom; and that she had by that method been informed that\\nthey had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in\\nwalking about the garden and going all over the house.\\n\\nElinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very\\nunlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter\\nthe house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the\\nsmallest acquaintance.\\n\\nAs soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;\\nand great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance\\nrelated by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry\\nwith her for doubting it.\\n\\n\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we\\ndid not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do\\nyourself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and\\nwith no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I have found you out in spite of all your tricks._\"]\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to\\nshow that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was\\nimpossible to have any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter\\nmorning in my life.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness of an employment\\ndoes not always evince its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for\\nif there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have\\nbeen sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting\\nwrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very\\nimpertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of\\nyour own conduct?\"\\n\\n\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of\\nimpropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our\\nlives. I value not her censure any more than I should do her\\ncommendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in\\nwalking over Mrs. Smith\\'s grounds, or in seeing her house. They will\\none day be Mr. Willoughby\\'s, and--\"\\n\\n\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be\\njustified in what you have done.\"\\n\\nShe blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;\\nand after a ten minutes\\' interval of earnest thought, she came to her\\nsister again, and said with great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it\\n_was_ rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby\\nwanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house,\\nI assure you. There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs;\\nof a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture\\nit would be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two\\nsides. On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the\\nhouse, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view\\nof the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills\\nthat we have so often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for\\nnothing could be more forlorn than the furniture; but if it were newly\\nfitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it\\none of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England.\"\\n\\nCould Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the\\nothers, she would have described every room in the house with equal\\ndelight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nThe sudden termination of Colonel Brandon\\'s visit at the park, with\\nhis steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised\\nthe wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great\\nwonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all\\nthe comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She wondered, with\\nlittle intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there\\nmust be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that\\ncould have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not\\nescape them all.\\n\\n\"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,\" said she.\\n\"I could see it in his face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances\\nmay be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two\\nthousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do\\nthink he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else\\ncan it be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know\\nthe truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I\\ndare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.\\nMay be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I\\nhave a notion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is\\nabout Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed\\nin his circumstances _now_, for he is a very prudent man, and to be\\nsure must have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can\\nbe! May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.\\nHis setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him\\nout of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the\\nbargain.\"\\n\\nSo wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every\\nfresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.\\nElinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel\\nBrandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\\naway, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides\\nthat the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting\\namazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise\\ndisposed of. It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her\\nsister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be\\npeculiarly interesting to them all. As this silence continued, every\\nday made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the\\ndisposition of both. Why they should not openly acknowledge to her\\nmother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other\\ndeclared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.\\n\\nShe could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in\\ntheir power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no\\nreason to believe him rich. His estate had been rated by Sir John at\\nabout six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which\\nthat income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\\nof his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by\\nthem relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at\\nall, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to\\ntheir general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\\nher mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to\\nprevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.\\n\\nNothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than\\nWilloughby\\'s behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing\\ntenderness which a lover\\'s heart could give, and to the rest of the\\nfamily it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The\\ncottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many\\nmore of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general\\nengagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him\\nout in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest\\nof the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\\nfavourite pointer at her feet.\\n\\nOne evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the\\ncountry, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of\\nattachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood\\'s happening\\nto mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he\\nwarmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had\\nestablished as perfect with him.\\n\\n\"What!\" he exclaimed, \"Improve this dear cottage! No. _That_ I will\\nnever consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch\\nto its size, if my feelings are regarded.\"\\n\\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood, \"nothing of the kind will be\\ndone; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.\"\\n\\n\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried. \"May she always be poor, if she\\ncan employ her riches no better.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not\\nsacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one\\nwhom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it\\nthat whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in\\nthe spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it\\nin a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this\\nplace as to see no defect in it?\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said he. \"To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as\\nthe only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I\\nrich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again\\nin the exact plan of this cottage.\"\\n\\n\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,\" said\\nElinor.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all and every thing\\nbelonging to it--in no one convenience or inconvenience about it,\\nshould the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under\\nsuch a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at\\nBarton.\"\\n\\n\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under the disadvantage\\nof better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your\\nown house as faultless as you now do this.\"\\n\\n\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby, \"which might\\ngreatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of\\nmy affection, which no other can possibly share.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were\\nfixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she\\nunderstood him.\\n\\n\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at Allenham this time\\ntwelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within\\nview of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one\\nshould live in it. How little did I then think that the very first\\nnews I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,\\nwould be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate\\nsatisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of\\nprescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account\\nfor. Must it not have been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered\\nvoice. Then continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this house\\nyou would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by\\nimaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance\\nfirst began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by\\nus together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\\nand every body would be eager to pass through the room which has\\nhitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort\\nthan any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world\\ncould possibly afford.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should\\nbe attempted.\\n\\n\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied. \"Your promise makes me\\neasy. Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me\\nthat not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever\\nfind you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will\\nalways consider me with the kindness which has made everything\\nbelonging to you so dear to me.\"\\n\\nThe promise was readily given, and Willoughby\\'s behaviour during the\\nwhole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.\\n\\n\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was\\nleaving them. \"I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must\\nwalk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.\"\\n\\nHe engaged to be with them by four o\\'clock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood\\'s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and\\ntwo of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from\\nbeing of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her\\nmother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the\\nnight before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly\\nsatisfied with her remaining at home.\\n\\nOn their return from the park they found Willoughby\\'s curricle and\\nservant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced\\nthat her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had\\nforeseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had\\ntaught her to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne\\ncame hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with\\nher handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\\nSurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had\\njust quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning\\nagainst the mantelpiece with his back towards them. He turned round\\non their coming in, and his countenance showed that he strongly\\npartook of the emotion which overpowered Marianne.\\n\\n\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she\\nentered:--\"is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced\\nsmile presently added, \"It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I\\nam now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!\"\\n\\n\"Disappointment?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has\\nthis morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent\\ncousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my\\ndispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of\\nexhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\\n\\n\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Almost this moment.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Apparently in violent affliction._]\\n\\n\"This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged, and her\\nbusiness will not detain you from us long I hope.\"\\n\\nHe coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I have no idea of\\nreturning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are\\nnever repeated within the twelvemonth.\"\\n\\n\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the\\nneighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can\\nyou wait for an invitation here?\"\\n\\nHis colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only\\nreplied, \"You are too good.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal\\namazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first\\nspoke.\\n\\n\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you\\nwill always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here\\nimmediately, because you only can judge how far _that_ might be\\npleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed\\nto question your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\\n\\n\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby, confusedly, \"are of\\nsuch a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself--\"\\n\\nHe stopped. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and\\nanother pause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with\\na faint smile, \"It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not\\ntorment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it\\nis impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\\n\\nHe then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him\\nstep into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the\\nparlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this\\nsudden departure occasioned.\\n\\nElinor\\'s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother\\'s. She thought of\\nwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby\\'s behaviour\\nin taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of\\ncheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother\\'s\\ninvitation--a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike\\nhimself--greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious\\ndesign had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some\\nunfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister. The\\ndistress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious\\nquarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered\\nwhat Marianne\\'s love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\\n\\nBut whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her\\nsister\\'s affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the\\ntenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all\\nprobability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and\\nencouraging as a duty.\\n\\nIn about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were\\nred, her countenance was not uncheerful.\\n\\n\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\" said she,\\nas she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart does he travel?\"\\n\\n\"It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work\\nof a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so\\naffectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice,--gone too\\nwithout intending to return! Something more than what he owned to us\\nmust have happened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.\\n_You_ must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can\\nthey have quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness\\nto accept your invitation here?\"\\n\\n\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see\\n_that._ He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all\\nover I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at\\nfirst seemed strange to me as well as to you.\"\\n\\n\"Can you, indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; but\\nyou, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy\\n_you_, I know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it. I am\\npersuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\\ndisapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and\\non that account is eager to get him away; and that the business which\\nshe sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss\\nhim. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware\\nthat she _does_ disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at\\npresent confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels\\nhimself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her\\nschemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell\\nme, I know, that this may or may _not_ have happened; but I will\\nlisten to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of\\nunderstanding the affair as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor,\\nwhat have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have\\nhappened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had\\nrather take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for\\nmisery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology\\nfor the latter. You are resolved to think him blamable, because he\\ntook leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has\\nshown. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits\\ndepressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be\\naccepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to\\nthe man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the\\nworld to think ill of?--to the possibility of motives unanswerable in\\nthemselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all,\\nwhat is it you suspect him of?\"\\n\\n\"I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is\\nthe inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed\\nin him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of\\nthe allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be\\ncandid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have\\nvery sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\\nBut it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at\\nonce. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at\\nits being practiced by him.\"\\n\\n\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where\\nthe deviation is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of\\nwhat I have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\\n\\n\"Not entirely. It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they\\n_are_ engaged) from Mrs. Smith; and if that is the case, it must be\\nhighly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at\\npresent. But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\\n\\n\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and\\nMarianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have\\nbeen reproaching them every day for incautiousness.\"\\n\\n\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor; \"but of their\\nengagement I do.\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"\\n\\n\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has\\nnot his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last\\nfortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future\\nwife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?\\nHave we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been\\ndaily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate\\nrespect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How\\ncould such a thought occur to you? How is it to be supposed that\\nWilloughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister\\'s love, should\\nleave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of\\nhis affection,--that they should part without a mutual exchange of\\nconfidence?\"\\n\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance except _one_ is\\nin favour of their engagement; but that _one_ is the total silence of\\nboth on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\\n\\n\"How strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,\\nif, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the\\nnature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a\\npart in his behaviour to your sister all this time? Do you suppose him\\nreally indifferent to her?\"\\n\\n\"No, I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such\\nindifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this\\nmatter as certain. I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are\\nfainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away. If we\\nfind they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.\"\\n\\n\"A mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar, you\\nwould suppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I\\nrequire no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to\\njustify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly\\nopen and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister\\'s wishes. It must be\\nWilloughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of\\nhonour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to\\ncreate alarm? can he be deceitful?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor. \"I love Willoughby,\\nsincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more\\npainful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will\\nnot encourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his\\nmanners this morning; he did not speak like himself, and did not\\nreturn your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be\\nexplained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He\\nhad just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest\\naffliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.\\nSmith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware\\nthat by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away\\nfor some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part\\nby our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a\\ncase, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more\\nto his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general\\ncharacter;--but I will not raise objections against any one\\'s conduct\\non so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,\\nor a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.\"\\n\\n\"You speak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be\\nsuspected. Though _we_ have not known him long, he is no stranger in\\nthis part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?\\nHad he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging\\neverything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is an\\nengagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage\\nmust be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it\\ncan be observed, may now be very advisable.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then\\nat liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to\\nacknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.\\n\\nThey saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the\\nroom and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes\\nwere red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then\\nrestrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could\\nneither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother\\'s silently\\npressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of\\nfortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.\\n\\nThis violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. She\\nwas without any power, because she was without any desire of command\\nover herself. The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby\\noverpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most\\nanxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if\\nthey spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings\\nconnected with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nMarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able\\nto sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She\\nwould have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next\\nmorning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than\\nwhen she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a\\ndisgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake the\\nwhole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with a\\nheadache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding\\nall attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent\\nenough!\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about\\nthe village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment\\nand crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.\\n\\nThe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She played\\nover every favourite song that she had been used to play to\\nWilloughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined,\\nand sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had\\nwritten out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther\\nsadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day\\napplied. She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing\\nand crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. In books\\ntoo, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast\\nbetween the past and present was certain of giving. She read nothing\\nbut what they had been used to read together.\\n\\nSuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it\\nsunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these\\nemployments, to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and\\nsilent meditations, still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as\\nlively as ever.\\n\\nNo letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.\\nHer mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs.\\nDashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at\\nleast satisfied herself.\\n\\n\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John fetches our\\nletters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already\\nagreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it\\ncould not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through\\nSir John\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nElinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a\\nmotive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so\\ndirect, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real\\nstate of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she\\ncould not help suggesting it to her mother.\\n\\n\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she, \"whether she is or\\nshe is not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind,\\nso indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would\\nbe the natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all\\nunreserve, and to you more especially.\"\\n\\n\"I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible\\nthat they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry\\ninflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never\\ndeserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of\\nwhat is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know\\nMarianne\\'s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall\\nnot be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances\\nmake the revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the\\nconfidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty\\nwould prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.\"\\n\\nElinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister\\'s\\nyouth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common\\ncare, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s romantic\\ndelicacy.\\n\\nIt was several days before Willoughby\\'s name was mentioned before\\nMarianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed,\\nwere not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;\\nbut one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of\\nShakespeare, exclaimed--\\n\\n\"We have never finished _Hamlet_, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went\\naway before we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he\\ncomes again--; But it may be months, perhaps, before _that_ happens.\"\\n\\n\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise. \"No--nor many weeks.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor\\npleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of\\nconfidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was\\nprevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of\\nwandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided every\\ncompanion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the\\ndowns, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of\\nthe valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never\\nbe found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the\\nexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.\\nThey walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\\nfor Marianne\\'s _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied\\nwith gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the\\nentrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less\\nwild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had\\ntravelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching\\nthat point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\\nwhich formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot\\nwhich they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before.\\n\\nAmongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated\\none; it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes\\nthey could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment\\nafterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed--\\n\\n\"It is he; it is indeed--I know it is!\" and was hastening to meet him,\\nwhen Elinor cried out--\\n\\n\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The\\nperson is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.\"\\n\\n\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has. His air, his\\ncoat, his horse. I knew how soon he would come.\"\\n\\nShe walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne\\nfrom particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being\\nWilloughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon\\nwithin thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart\\nsunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back,\\nwhen the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a\\nthird, almost as well known as Willoughby\\'s, joined them in begging\\nher to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\\nEdward Ferrars.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Begging her to stop._]\\n\\nHe was the only person in the world who could at that moment be\\nforgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained\\na smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on _him_, and\\nin her sister\\'s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\\n\\nHe dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with\\nthem to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.\\n\\nHe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by\\nMarianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him\\nthan even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between\\nEdward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable\\ncoldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual\\nbehaviour. On Edward\\'s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\\nof all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was\\nconfused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked\\nneither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by\\nquestions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne\\nsaw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a\\ndislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her,\\nby carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a\\ncontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\\n\\nAfter a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries\\nof meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No,\\nhe had been in Devonshire a fortnight.\\n\\n\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the\\nsame county with Elinor without seeing her before.\\n\\nHe looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with\\nsome friends near Plymouth.\\n\\n\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\\n\\n\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks much as it always\\ndoes at this time of the year--the woods and walks thickly covered\\nwith dead leaves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation have I\\nformerly seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see\\nthem driven in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they,\\nthe season, the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard\\nthem. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven\\nas much as possible from the sight.\"\\n\\n\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your passion for dead\\nleaves.\"\\n\\n\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But\\n_sometimes_ they are.\" As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a\\nfew moments; but rousing herself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she,\\ncalling his attention to the prospect, \"here is Barton valley. Look up\\nto it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever\\nsee their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and\\nplantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that\\nfarthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\\n\\n\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these bottoms must be\\ndirty in winter.\"\\n\\n\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the objects before\\nme, I see a very dirty lane.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\\n\\n\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant\\npeople?\"\\n\\n\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not be more unfortunately\\nsituated.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can you be so\\nunjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards\\nus have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne,\\nhow many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many painful moments.\"\\n\\nElinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their\\nvisitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by\\ntalking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting\\nfrom him occasional questions and remarks. His coldness and reserve\\nmortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to\\nregulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present,\\nshe avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated\\nhim as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his\\ncoming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.\\nHer joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received\\nthe kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\\nstand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he\\nentered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating\\nmanners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love\\nwith either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her;\\nand Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like\\nhimself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his\\ninterest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not in\\nspirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was\\nattentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. The whole family\\nperceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of\\nliberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\\nselfish parents.\\n\\n\"What are Mrs. Ferrars\\'s views for you at present, Edward?\" said she,\\nwhen dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; \"are you still\\nto be a great orator in spite of yourself?\"\\n\\n\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents\\nthan inclination for a public life!\"\\n\\n\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to\\nsatisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no\\naffection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find\\nit a difficult matter.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have\\nevery reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced\\ninto genius and eloquence.\"\\n\\n\"You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate.\"\\n\\n\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as\\nwell as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body\\nelse it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so.\"\\n\\n\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne. \"What have wealth or grandeur\\nto do with happiness?\"\\n\\n\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth has much to do\\nwith it.\"\\n\\n\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only give happiness\\nwhere there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can\\nafford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come to the same point.\\n_Your_ competence and _my_ wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and\\nwithout them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\\nkind of external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more\\nnoble than mine. Come, what is your competence?\"\\n\\n\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than _that._\"\\n\\nElinor laughed. \"_Two_ thousand a year! _One_ is my wealth! I guessed\\nhow it would end.\"\\n\\n\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\" said\\nMarianne. \"A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure\\nI am not extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of\\nservants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on\\nless.\"\\n\\nElinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their\\nfuture expenses at Combe Magna.\\n\\n\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward; \"but why must you have hunters? Every body\\ndoes not hunt.\"\\n\\nMarianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, \"that somebody\\nwould give us all a large fortune a-piece!\"\\n\\n\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with\\nanimation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary\\nhappiness.\\n\\n\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\" said Elinor, \"in spite\\nof the insufficiency of wealth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be! I wonder what I\\nshould do with it!\"\\n\\nMarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\\n\\n\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\" said Mrs.\\nDashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich without my help.\"\\n\\n\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\" observed Elinor,\\n\"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"\\n\\n\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,\"\\nsaid Edward, \"in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers,\\nmusic-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a\\ngeneral commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as\\nfor Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music\\nenough in London to content her. And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\\nScott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up\\nevery copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;\\nand she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old\\ntwisted tree. Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very\\nsaucy. But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old\\ndisputes.\"\\n\\n\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy\\nor gay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking\\nof former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be\\nspent; some of it, at least--my loose cash--would certainly be\\nemployed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\\n\\n\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the\\nauthors or their heirs.\"\\n\\n\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who\\nwrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever\\nbe in love more than once in their life--for your opinion on that\\npoint is unchanged, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is\\nnot likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor, \"she is not\\nat all altered.\"\\n\\n\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me. You are not\\nvery gay yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh. \"But gaiety never\\nwas a part of _my_ character.\"\\n\\n\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne\\'s,\" said Elinor; \"I should\\nhardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all\\nshe does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but\\nshe is not often really merry.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I have always set her\\ndown as a lively girl.\"\\n\\n\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\" said\\nElinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some point or\\nother: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or\\nstupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the\\ndeception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of\\nthemselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"\\n\\n\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"to be guided\\nwholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were\\ngiven us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has\\nalways been your doctrine, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of\\nthe understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the\\nbehaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess,\\nof having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with\\ngreater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their\\nsentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?\"\\n\\n\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of\\ngeneral civility,\" said Edward to Elinor, \"Do you gain no ground?\"\\n\\n\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor, looking expressively at\\nMarianne.\\n\\n\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side of the question; but\\nI am afraid my practice is much more on your sister\\'s. I never wish to\\noffend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I\\nam only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought\\nthat I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I\\nam so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!\"\\n\\n\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,\" said\\nElinor.\\n\\n\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\" replied Edward.\\n\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or\\nother. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy\\nand graceful, I should not be shy.\"\\n\\n\"But you would still be reserved,\" said Marianne, \"and that is worse.\"\\n\\nEdward started. \"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring. \"Reserved!--how, in\\nwhat manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?\"\\n\\nElinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the\\nsubject, she said to him, \"Do not you know my sister well enough to\\nunderstand what she means? Do not you know she calls every one\\nreserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as\\nrapturously as herself?\"\\n\\nEdward made no answer. His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him\\nin their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nElinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His\\nvisit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own\\nenjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was\\nunhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still\\ndistinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no\\ndoubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference\\nseemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her\\ncontradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the\\npreceding one.\\n\\nHe joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning\\nbefore the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to\\npromote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to\\nthemselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour\\ndoor open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself\\ncome out.\\n\\n\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\" said he, \"as you are\\nnot yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nEdward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding\\ncountry; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the\\nvalley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher\\nsituation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole,\\nwhich had exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured\\nMarianne\\'s attention, and she was beginning to describe her own\\nadmiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the\\nobjects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her\\nby saying, \"You must not enquire too far, Marianne: remember I have no\\nknowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\\nand want of taste if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep,\\nwhich ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to\\nbe irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought\\nonly to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\\nYou must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I\\ncall it a very fine country,--the hills are steep, the woods seem full\\nof fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug,--with rich\\nmeadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It\\nexactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty\\nwith utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you\\nadmire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and\\npromontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\\nI know nothing of the picturesque.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne; \"but why should you\\nboast of it?\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind of affectation,\\nEdward here falls into another. Because he believes many people\\npretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really\\nfeel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater\\nindifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he\\npossesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration of landscape\\nscenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries\\nto describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\npicturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I\\nhave kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to\\ndescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and\\nmeaning.\"\\n\\n\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel all the delight\\nin a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your\\nsister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine\\nprospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked,\\ntwisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall,\\nstraight, and flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I\\nam not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more\\npleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower,--and a troop of\\ntidy, happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the\\nworld.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her\\nsister. Elinor only laughed.\\n\\nThe subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained\\nthoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.\\nShe was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,\\nhis hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a\\nplait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\\n\\n\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried. \"Is that\\nFanny\\'s hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I should\\nhave thought her hair had been darker.\"\\n\\nMarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt; but when she saw\\nhow much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of\\nthought could not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and\\ngiving a momentary glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister\\'s\\nhair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.\"\\n\\nElinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair\\nwas her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;\\nthe only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne\\nconsidered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must\\nhave been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\\nShe was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and\\naffecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of\\nsomething else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every\\nopportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all\\ndoubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.\\n\\nEdward\\'s embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of\\nmind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning.\\nMarianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own\\nforgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little\\noffence it had given her sister.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.\\nJennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the\\ncottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of\\nhis mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name\\nof Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of\\nraillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of\\ntheir acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being\\nimmediately sprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very\\nsignificant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret\\'s\\ninstructions, extended.\\n\\nSir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to\\ndine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.\\nOn the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their\\nvisitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,\\nhe wished to engage them for both.\\n\\n\"You _must_ drink tea with us to night,\" said he, \"for we shall be\\nquite alone; and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we\\nshall be a large party.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. \"And who knows but you may raise\\na dance,\" said she. \"And that will tempt _you_, Miss Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"A dance!\" cried Marianne. \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Came to take a survey of the guest._]\\n\\n\"Who? why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.\\nWhat! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that\\nshall be nameless is gone!\"\\n\\n\"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John, \"that Willoughby were among\\nus again.\"\\n\\nThis, and Marianne\\'s blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. \"And who\\nis Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he\\nwas sitting.\\n\\nShe gave him a brief reply. Marianne\\'s countenance was more\\ncommunicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning\\nof others, but such of Marianne\\'s expressions as had puzzled him\\nbefore; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round\\nher, and said, in a whisper, \"I have been guessing. Shall I tell you\\nmy guess?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"\\n\\nMarianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at\\nthe quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment\\'s silence, said--\\n\\n\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope--I am sure\\nyou will like him.\"\\n\\n\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness\\nand warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of\\nher acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing\\nbetween Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to\\nmention it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nEdward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by\\nMrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on\\nself-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment\\namong his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two\\nor three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he\\ngrew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of\\ngoing away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly\\ndisengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left\\nthem--but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly--he\\ncould hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other\\nthings he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the\\nlie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being\\nin town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their\\nkindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being\\nwith them. Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of\\ntheir wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.\\n\\nElinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his\\nmother\\'s account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose\\ncharacter was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse\\nfor every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,\\nand vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain\\nbehaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to\\nregard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous\\nqualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from\\nher, for Willoughby\\'s service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of\\nopenness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want\\nof independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s\\ndisposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of\\nhis purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered\\ninclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his\\nmother. The old well-established grievance of duty against will,\\nparent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad\\nto know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to\\nyield, when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty\\nto be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for\\ncomfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward\\'s affection, to the\\nremembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from\\nhim while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it\\nwhich he constantly wore round his finger.\\n\\n\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the\\nlast morning, \"you would be a happier man if you had any profession to\\nengage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some\\ninconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would\\nnot be able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you\\nwould be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would\\nknow where to go when you left them.\"\\n\\n\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long thought on this\\npoint, as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always\\nbe a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to\\nengage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing\\nlike independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of\\nmy friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never\\ncould agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the\\nchurch, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family.\\nThey recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The\\nlaw was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers\\nin the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and\\ndrove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for\\nthe law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family\\napproved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too\\nold when the subject was first started to enter it; and, at length, as\\nthere was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might\\nbe as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one,\\nidleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and\\nhonourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\\nbent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do\\nnothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle\\never since.\"\\n\\n\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\\n\"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons\\nwill be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and\\ntrades as Columella\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent, \"to be as\\nunlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in\\nevery thing.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,\\nEdward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike\\nyourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from\\nfriends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\\neducation or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but\\npatience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your\\nmother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so\\nanxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her\\nhappiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\\nHow much may not a few months do?\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many months to produce any\\ngood to me.\"\\n\\nThis desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to\\nMrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which\\nshortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor\\'s\\nfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.\\nBut as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself\\nfrom appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his\\ngoing away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by\\nMarianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by\\nseeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different\\nas their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.\\n\\nElinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the\\nhouse, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor\\navoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost\\nas much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this\\nconduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\\nfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much\\nsolicitude on her account.\\n\\nSuch behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no\\nmore meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.\\nThe business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\\naffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.\\nThat her sister\\'s affections _were_ calm, she dared not deny, though\\nshe blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she\\ngave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that\\nsister, in spite of this mortifying conviction.\\n\\nWithout shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in\\ndetermined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to\\nindulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\nto think of Edward, and of Edward\\'s behaviour, in every possible\\nvariety which the different state of her spirits at different times\\ncould produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and\\ndoubt. There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of\\nher mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\\nconversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude\\nwas produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could\\nnot be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so\\ninteresting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\\nher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\\n\\nFrom a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was\\nroused one morning, soon after Edward\\'s leaving them, by the arrival\\nof company. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little\\ngate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew\\nher eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the\\ndoor. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\\nbut there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite\\nunknown to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir\\nJohn perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of\\nknocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to\\nopen the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short\\nbetween the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to\\nspeak at one without being heard at the other.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers. How do you like\\nthem?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! they will hear you.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very\\npretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way.\"\\n\\nAs Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without\\ntaking that liberty, she begged to be excused.\\n\\n\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her\\ninstrument is open.\"\\n\\n\"She is walking, I believe.\"\\n\\nThey were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to\\nwait till the door was opened before she told _her_ story. She came\\nhallooing to the window, \"How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs.\\nDashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be\\nglad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son\\nand daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I\\nthought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of\\nnothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again;\\nso I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is\\nColonel Brandon come back again--\"\\n\\nElinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to\\nreceive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two\\nstrangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same\\ntime, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs.\\nJennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into\\nthe parlour, attended by Sir John.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally\\nunlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very\\npretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\npossibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister\\'s,\\nbut they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile,\\nsmiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled\\nwhen she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five\\nor six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his\\nwife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the\\nroom with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies,\\nwithout speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\\napartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read\\nit as long as he stayed.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with\\na turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before\\nher admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.\\n\\n\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so\\ncharming! Only think, Mamma, how it is improved since I was here last!\\nI always thought it such a sweet place, ma\\'am! (turning to Mrs.\\nDashwood) but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how\\ndelightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!\\nShould not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\\n\\nMr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from\\nthe newspaper.\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing; \"he never does\\nsometimes. It is so ridiculous!\"\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to\\nfind wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking\\nwith surprise at them both.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and\\ncontinued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing\\ntheir friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer\\nlaughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every\\nbody agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an\\nagreeable surprise.\\n\\n\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\" added Mrs.\\nJennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice\\nas if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on\\ndifferent sides of the room; \"but, however, I can\\'t help wishing they\\nhad not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,\\nfor they came all round by London upon account of some business, for\\nyou know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was\\nwrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this\\nmorning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you\\nall!\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.\\n\\n\"She expects to be confined in February,\" continued Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\nLady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and\\ntherefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in\\nthe paper.\\n\\n\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\\n\\n\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John. \"Now, Palmer, you shall see a\\nmonstrous pretty girl.\"\\n\\nHe immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and\\nushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she\\nappeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so\\nheartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Palmer\\nlooked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and\\nthen returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer\\'s eye was now caught by\\nthe drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I declare they are quite charming_.\"]\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look,\\nmama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at\\nthem for ever.\" And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that\\nthere were any such things in the room.\\n\\nWhen Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down\\nthe newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.\\n\\n\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\\n\\nHe made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the\\nroom, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.\\nHe then made his bow, and departed with the rest.\\n\\nSir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at\\nthe park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not choose to dine with them oftener\\nthan they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\\nher daughters might do as they pleased. But they had no curiosity to\\nsee how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of\\npleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore,\\nlikewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not\\nlikely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage\\nshould be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though\\nshe did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.\\nPalmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a\\nfamily party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.\\n\\n\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.\\n\"The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very\\nhard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying\\neither with them, or with us.\"\\n\\n\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\" said Elinor, \"by\\nthese frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them\\na few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are\\ngrown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\n\\nAs the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next\\nday, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as\\ngood humoured and merry as before. She took them all most\\naffectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them\\nagain.\\n\\n\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself between Elinor\\nand Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,\\nwhich would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must\\ngo, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a\\nsudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the\\ncarriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\\nwould go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any\\nthing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet\\nagain in town very soon, I hope.\"\\n\\nThey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\\n\\n\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, \"I shall be quite\\ndisappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in world for\\nyou, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am\\nsure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am\\nconfined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.\"\\n\\nThey thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.\\n\\n\"Oh, my love,\" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered\\nthe room--\"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to\\ntown this winter.\"\\n\\nHer love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies,\\nbegan complaining of the weather.\\n\\n\"How horrid all this is!\" said he. \"Such weather makes every thing and\\nevery body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as\\nwithout, by rain. It makes one detest all one\\'s acquaintance. What the\\ndevil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house?\\nHow few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the\\nweather.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the company soon dropt in.\\n\\n\"I am afraid, Miss Marianne,\" said Sir John, \"you have not been able\\nto take your usual walk to Allenham today.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked very grave and said nothing.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t be so sly before us,\" said Mrs. Palmer; \"for we know all\\nabout it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think\\nhe is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the\\ncountry, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"Much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.\\n\\n\"Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but\\nthey say it is a sweet pretty place.\"\\n\\n\"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\" said Mr. Palmer.\\n\\nMarianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed\\nher interest in what was said.\\n\\n\"Is it very ugly?\" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it must be some other\\nplace that is so pretty I suppose.\"\\n\\nWhen they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with\\nregret that they were only eight all together.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking that we should\\nbe so few. Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?\"\\n\\n\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,\\nthat it could not be done? They dined with us last.\"\\n\\n\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"should not stand upon such\\nceremony.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.\\n\\n\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife with her usual\\nlaugh. \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"\\n\\n\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother\\nill-bred.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured old lady,\\n\"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back\\nagain. So there I have the whip hand of you.\"\\n\\nCharlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid\\nof her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,\\nas they must live together. It was impossible for any one to be more\\nthoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.\\nPalmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her\\nhusband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was\\nhighly diverted.\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. \"He is\\nalways out of humour.\"\\n\\nElinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him\\ncredit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred\\nas he wished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured by\\nfinding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\\nbias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\\nwoman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any\\nsensible man to be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of\\ndistinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment\\nof every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It was\\nthe desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too\\ncommon to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by\\nestablishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to\\nattach any one to him except his wife.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, \"I have\\ngot such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and\\nspend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,--and come\\nwhile the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be!\\nIt will be quite delightful!--My love,\" applying to her husband,\\n\"don\\'t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"I came into Devonshire with no\\nother view.\"\\n\\n\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you\\ncannot refuse to come.\"\\n\\nThey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\\n\\n\"But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all\\nthings. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.\\nYou cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay\\nnow, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\nagainst the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I\\nnever saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very\\nfatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.\"\\n\\nElinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the\\nhardship of such an obligation.\\n\\n\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he is in\\nParliament!--won\\'t it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to\\nsee all his letters directed to him with an M.P. But do you know, he\\nsays, he will never frank for me? He declares he won\\'t. Don\\'t you, Mr.\\nPalmer?\"\\n\\nMr. Palmer took no notice of her.\\n\\n\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued; \"he says it is\\nquite shocking.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational. Don\\'t palm all\\nyour abuses of languages upon me.\"\\n\\n\"There now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him!\\nSometimes he won\\'t speak to me for half a day together, and then he\\ncomes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\\n\\nShe surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,\\nby asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Well--I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant;\\nand Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can\\ntell you, and you can\\'t think how disappointed he will be if you don\\'t\\ncome to Cleveland. I can\\'t imagine why you should object to it.\"\\n\\nElinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing\\nthe subject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable\\nthat as they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to\\ngive some more particular account of Willoughby\\'s general character,\\nthan could be gathered from the Middletons\\' partial acquaintance with\\nhim; and she was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of\\nhis merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She\\nbegan by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,\\nand whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\\n\\n\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\" replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not\\nthat I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in\\ntown. Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while\\nhe was at Allenham. Mama saw him here once before, but I was with my\\nuncle at Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great\\ndeal of him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily\\nthat we should never have been in the country together. He is very\\nlittle at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do\\nnot think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you\\nknow, and besides it is such a way off. I know why you inquire about\\nhim, very well; your sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of\\nit, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much more of the matter than\\nI do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body\\ntalks of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour I did. I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in\\nBond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.\"\\n\\n\"You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you\\nmust be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not\\nbe interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect\\nColonel Brandon to do.\"\\n\\n\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how\\nit happened. When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and\\nso we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and\\nanother, and I said to him, \\'So, Colonel, there is a new family come\\nto Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very\\npretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby\\nof Combe Magna. Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you\\nhave been in Devonshire so lately.\\'\"\\n\\n\"And what did the Colonel say?\"\\n\\n\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true,\\nso from that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite\\ndelightful, I declare! When is it to take place?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but\\nsay fine things of you.\"\\n\\n\"I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I\\nthink him uncommonly pleasing.\"\\n\\n\"So do I. He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should\\nbe so grave and so dull. Mamma says _he_ was in love with your sister\\ntoo. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly\\never falls in love with any body.\"\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?\" said\\nElinor.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are\\nacquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all\\nthink him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than\\nMr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She\\nis a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he\\nis much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and\\nagreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don\\'t\\nthink her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think\\nyou both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,\\nthough we could not get him to own it last night.\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s information respecting Willoughby was not very material;\\nbut any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.\\n\\n\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\" continued Charlotte.\\n\"And now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can\\'t think how\\nmuch I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at\\nthe cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your\\nsister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at\\nCombe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts.\"\\n\\n\"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He was a particular\\nfriend of Sir John\\'s. I believe,\" she added in a low voice, \"he would\\nhave been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady\\nMiddleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good\\nenough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the\\nColonel, and we should have been married immediately.\"\\n\\n\"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John\\'s proposal to your mother\\nbefore it was made? Had he never owned his affection to yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have\\nliked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it\\nwas before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr.\\nPalmer is the kind of man I like.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\n\\nThe Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families\\nat Barton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not\\nlast long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head,\\nhad hardly done wondering at Charlotte\\'s being so happy without a\\ncause, at Mr. Palmer\\'s acting so simply, with good abilities, and at\\nthe strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and\\nwife, before Sir John\\'s and Mrs. Jennings\\'s active zeal in the cause\\nof society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and\\nobserve.\\n\\nIn a morning\\'s excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young\\nladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be\\nher relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them\\ndirectly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter\\nwere over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such\\nan invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on\\nthe return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a\\nvisit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\\nelegance--whose tolerable gentility even--she could have no proof; for\\nthe assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\\nnothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the\\nworse; and Mrs. Jennings\\'s attempts at consolation were therefore\\nunfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\\ntheir being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\\nup with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\\ntheir coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\\nall the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with\\nmerely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or\\nsix times every day.\\n\\nThe young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel\\nor unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very\\ncivil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the\\nfurniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that\\nLady Middleton\\'s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they\\nhad been an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable\\ngirls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir\\nJohn\\'s confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise,\\nand he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of\\nthe Miss Steeles\\' arrival, and to assure them of their being the\\nsweetest girls in the world. From such commendation as this, however,\\nthere was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest\\ngirls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under\\nevery possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir\\nJohn wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at\\nhis guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even\\nto keep a third cousin to himself.\\n\\n\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I declare you shall\\ncome--You can\\'t think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous\\npretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all\\nhanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they\\nboth long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that\\nyou are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told\\nthem it is all very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted\\nwith them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of\\nplaythings for the children. How can you be so cross as not to come?\\nWhy they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. _You_ are my\\ncousins, and they are my wife\\'s, so you must be related.\"\\n\\nBut Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of\\ntheir calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in\\namazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their\\nattractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of\\nthe Miss Steeles to them.\\n\\nWhen their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to\\nthese young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the\\neldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible\\nface, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two\\nor three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\\nfeatures were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness\\nof air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave\\ndistinction to her person. Their manners were particularly civil, and\\nElinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw\\nwith what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves\\nagreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual\\nraptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\\ntheir whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the\\nimportunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in\\nadmiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be\\ndoing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in\\nwhich her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing\\ndelight. Fortunately for those who pay their court through such\\nfoibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children,\\nthe most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous;\\nher demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the\\nexcessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her\\noffspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest\\nsurprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the\\nimpertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins\\nsubmitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their\\nears, their work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen\\naway, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It\\nsuggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit\\nso composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.\\n\\n\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his taking Miss Steele\\'s\\npocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--\"He is full of\\nmonkey tricks.\"\\n\\nAnd soon afterwards, on the second boy\\'s violently pinching one of the\\nsame lady\\'s fingers, she fondly observed, \"How playful William is!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Mischievous tricks._]\\n\\n\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added, tenderly caressing\\na little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the\\nlast two minutes; \"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was\\nthere such a quiet little thing!\"\\n\\nBut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship\\'s\\nhead dress slightly scratching the child\\'s neck, produced from this\\npattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone\\nby any creature professedly noisy. The mother\\'s consternation was\\nexcessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and\\nevery thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which\\naffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little\\nsufferer. She was seated in her mother\\'s lap, covered with kisses, her\\nwound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was\\non her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by\\nthe other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to\\ncease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two\\nbrothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings\\nwere ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a\\nscene of similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been\\nsuccessfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of\\nscreams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that\\nit would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore in\\nher mother\\'s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys\\nchose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay\\nbehind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room\\nhad not known for many hours.\\n\\n\"Poor little creatures!\" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.\\n\"It might have been a very sad accident.\"\\n\\n\"Yet I hardly know how,\" cried Marianne, \"unless it had been under\\ntotally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of\\nheightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in\\nreality.\"\\n\\n\"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\" said Lucy Steele.\\n\\nMarianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not\\nfeel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the\\nwhole task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.\\nShe did her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton\\nwith more warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.\\n\\n\"And Sir John too,\" cried the elder sister, \"what a charming man he\\nis!\"\\n\\nHere too, Miss Dashwood\\'s commendation, being only simple and just,\\ncame in without any Èclat. She merely observed that he was perfectly\\ngood humoured and friendly.\\n\\n\"And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine\\nchildren in my life. I declare I quite doat upon them already, and\\nindeed I am always distractedly fond of children.\"\\n\\n\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile, \"from what I have\\nwitnessed this morning.\"\\n\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little Middletons rather\\ntoo much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it\\nis so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see\\nchildren full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame\\nand quiet.\"\\n\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that while I am at Barton Park, I never\\nthink of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.\"\\n\\nA short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss\\nSteele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now\\nsaid rather abruptly, \"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?\\nI suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\\n\\nIn some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of\\nthe manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.\\n\\n\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\" added Miss\\nSteele.\\n\\n\"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\" said Lucy, who seemed\\nto think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.\\n\\n\"I think every one _must_ admire it,\" replied Elinor, \"who ever saw\\nthe place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate\\nits beauties as we do.\"\\n\\n\"And had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not so\\nmany in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast\\naddition always.\"\\n\\n\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,\\n\"that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as\\nSussex?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, my dear, I\\'m sure I don\\'t pretend to say that there an\\'t. I\\'m\\nsure there\\'s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how\\ncould I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was\\nonly afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they\\nhad not so many as they used to have. But perhaps you young ladies may\\nnot care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with\\nthem. For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they\\ndress smart and behave civil. But I can\\'t bear to see them dirty and\\nnasty. Now there\\'s Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\\nquite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but\\nmeet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen. I suppose your\\nbrother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was\\nso rich?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you, for I do not\\nperfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that\\nif he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is\\nnot the smallest alteration in him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men\\'s being beaux--they have\\nsomething else to do.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of nothing but\\nbeaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing\\nelse.\" And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house\\nand the furniture.\\n\\nThis specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough. The vulgar freedom and\\nfolly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not\\nblinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want\\nof real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish\\nof knowing them better.\\n\\nNot so the Miss Steeles. They came from Exeter, well provided with\\nadmiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his\\nrelations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair\\ncousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,\\naccomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. And to be\\nbetter acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable\\nlot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,\\ntheir party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of\\nintimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or\\ntwo together in the same room almost every day. Sir John could do no\\nmore; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together\\nwas, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes\\nfor their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\\nestablished friends.\\n\\nTo do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their\\nunreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew\\nor supposed of his cousins\\' situations in the most delicate\\nparticulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the\\neldest of them wished her joy on her sister\\'s having been so lucky as\\nto make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.\\n\\n\"\\'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,\" said\\nshe, \"and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. And I\\nhope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may\\nhave a friend in the corner already.\"\\n\\nElinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in\\nproclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been\\nwith respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of\\nthe two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since\\nEdward\\'s visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to\\nher best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and\\nwinks, as to excite general attention. The letter F had been likewise\\ninvariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless\\njokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had\\nbeen long established with Elinor.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these\\njokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the\\nname of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently\\nexpressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\ninto the concerns of their family. But Sir John did not sport long\\nwith the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as\\nmuch pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.\\n\\n\"His name is Ferrars,\" said he, in a very audible whisper; \"but pray\\ndo not tell it, for it\\'s a great secret.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Drinking to her best affections._]\\n\\n\"Ferrars!\" repeated Miss Steele; \"Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?\\nWhat! your sister-in-law\\'s brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable\\nyoung man to be sure; I know him very well.\"\\n\\n\"How can you say so, Anne?\" cried Lucy, who generally made an\\namendment to all her sister\\'s assertions. \"Though we have seen him\\nonce or twice at my uncle\\'s, it is rather too much to pretend to know\\nhim very well.\"\\n\\nElinor heard all this with attention and surprise. \"And who was this\\nuncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?\" She wished very\\nmuch to have the subject continued, though she did not choose to join\\nin it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time\\nin her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity\\nafter petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The\\nmanner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her\\ncuriosity; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and\\nsuggested the suspicion of that lady\\'s knowing, or fancying herself to\\nknow something to his disadvantage. But her curiosity was unavailing,\\nfor no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars\\'s name by Miss Steele\\nwhen alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\n\\nMarianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like\\nimpertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of\\ntaste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from\\nthe state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to\\nencourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her\\nbehaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on\\ntheir side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself\\nwhich soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of\\nLucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of\\nstriving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank\\ncommunication of her sentiments.\\n\\nLucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing;\\nand as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her\\nagreeable; but her powers had received no aid from education: she was\\nignorant and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,\\nher want of information in the most common particulars, could not be\\nconcealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to\\nappear to advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of\\nabilities which education might have rendered so respectable; but she\\nsaw, with less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\\nof rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her\\nassiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have\\nno lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined\\ninsincerity with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their\\nmeeting in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward\\nothers made every show of attention and deference towards herself\\nperfectly valueless.\\n\\n\"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\" said Lucy to her\\none day, as they were walking together from the park to the\\ncottage--\"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your\\nsister-in-law\\'s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?\"\\n\\nElinor _did_ think the question a very odd one, and her countenance\\nexpressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I thought you must have\\nseen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what\\nsort of a woman she is?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward\\'s\\nmother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent\\ncuriosity; \"I know nothing of her.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such\\na way,\" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; \"but\\nperhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I\\nhope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be\\nimpertinent.\"\\n\\nElinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in\\nsilence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by\\nsaying, with some hesitation--\\n\\n\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I\\nwould rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person\\nwhose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I\\nshould not have the smallest fear of trusting _you_; indeed, I should\\nbe very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable\\nsituation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble\\n_you._ I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry I do _not_,\" said Elinor, in great astonishment, \"if it\\ncould be of any use to _you_ to know my opinion of her. But really I\\nnever understood that you were at all connected with that family, and\\ntherefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry\\ninto her character.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But\\nif I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs.\\nFerrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time _may_\\ncome--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be\\nvery intimately connected.\"\\n\\nShe looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side\\nglance at her companion to observe its effect on her.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean? Are you acquainted\\nwith Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?\" And she did not feel much\\ndelighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. _Robert_ Ferrars--I never saw him in\\nmy life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon Elinor, \"to his eldest brother.\"\\n\\nWhat felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as\\npainful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the\\nassertion attended it. She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,\\nunable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and\\nthough her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt\\nin no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\\n\\n\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy; \"for to be sure you could\\nhave had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the\\nsmallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was\\nalways meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully\\nkept so by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it\\nbut Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not\\nfelt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I\\nreally thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs.\\nFerrars must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not\\nthink Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted\\nyou, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all\\nyour family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods\\nquite as his own sisters.\"--She paused.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Amiably bashful._]\\n\\nElinor for a few moments remained silent. Her astonishment at what she\\nheard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself\\nto speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--\"May I ask\\nif your engagement is of long standing?\"\\n\\n\"We have been engaged these four years.\"\\n\\n\"Four years!\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nElinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.\\n\\n\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even acquainted till the\\nother day.\"\\n\\n\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my\\nuncle\\'s care, you know, a considerable while.\"\\n\\n\"Your uncle!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?\"\\n\\n\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which\\nincreased with her increase of emotion.\\n\\n\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near\\nPlymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me\\nwas often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was\\nformed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he\\nwas almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter\\ninto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of\\nhis mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so\\nprudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well as\\nme, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he\\nis very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after\\na moment\\'s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward\\'s\\nhonour and love, and her companion\\'s falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\\nFerrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,\\nthat really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake\\nof person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling. \"Mr. Edward Ferrars, the\\neldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your\\nsister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must\\nallow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on\\nwho all my happiness depends.\"\\n\\n\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, \"that I\\nshould never have heard him even mention your name.\"\\n\\n\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has\\nbeen to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,\\nand, therefore, there could be no _occasion_ for ever mentioning my\\nname to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister\\'s\\nsuspecting any thing, _that_ was reason enough for his not mentioning\\nit.\"\\n\\nShe was silent. Elinor\\'s security sunk; but her self-command did not\\nsink with it.\\n\\n\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she with a firm voice.\\n\\n\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor\\nEdward! It puts him quite out of heart.\" Then taking a small miniature\\nfrom her pocket, she added, \"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be\\nso good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be\\nsure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was\\ndrew for. I have had it above these three years.\"\\n\\nShe put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the\\npainting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or\\nher wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind,\\nshe could have none of its being Edward\\'s face. She returned it almost\\ninstantly, acknowledging the likeness.\\n\\n\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give him my picture in\\nreturn, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so\\nanxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first\\nopportunity.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly. They then\\nproceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world of your\\nfaithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of what\\nimportance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother; for she\\nwould never approve of it, I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I\\nfancy she is an exceeding proud woman.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor; \"but you do\\nme no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your\\nsecret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so\\nunnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being\\nacquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\\n\\nAs she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover\\nsomething in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest\\npart of what she had been saying; but Lucy\\'s countenance suffered no\\nchange.\\n\\n\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,\"\\nsaid she, \"in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be\\nsure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by\\ndescription a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as\\nif you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really\\nthought some explanation was due to you after my making such\\nparticular inquiries about Edward\\'s mother; and I am so unfortunate,\\nthat I have not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only\\nperson that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she\\ndoes me a great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of\\nher betraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you\\nmust perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world\\nt\\'other day, when Edward\\'s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she\\nshould out with it all. You can\\'t think how much I go through in my\\nmind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I\\nhave suffered for Edward\\'s sake these last four years. Every thing in\\nsuch suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly\\nmeet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite\\nbroke.\"\\n\\nHere she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very\\ncompassionate.\\n\\n\"Sometimes,\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, \"I think whether\\nit would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.\"\\nAs she said this, she looked directly at her companion. \"But then at\\nother times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the\\nthoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of\\nsuch a thing would do. And on my own account too--so dear as he is to\\nme--I don\\'t think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to\\ndo in such a case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question; \"but I can give\\nyou no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both\\nsides, \"his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor\\nEdward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful\\nlow-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left\\nus at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him\\nquite ill.\"\\n\\n\"Did he come from your uncle\\'s, then, when he visited us?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he\\ncame directly from town?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh\\ncircumstance in favour of Lucy\\'s veracity; \"I remember he told us,\\nthat he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"\\nShe remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning\\nnothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect\\neven to their names.\\n\\n\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\" repeated Lucy.\\n\\n\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\\n\\n\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was\\nthe matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more\\nthan a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor\\nfellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes\\nin wretched spirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter;\"\\ntaking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction\\nto Elinor. \"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but\\nthat is not written so well as usual. He was tired, I dare say, for he\\nhad just filled the sheet to me as full as possible.\"\\n\\nElinor saw that it _was_ his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This\\npicture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been\\naccidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward\\'s gift; but a\\ncorrespondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a\\npositive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few\\nmoments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she\\ncould hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she\\nstruggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that\\nher success was speedy, and for the time complete.\\n\\n\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the letter into her\\npocket, \"is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, I\\nhave one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even\\n_that._ If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. I gave\\nhim a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last,\\nand that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.\\nPerhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?\"\\n\\n\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was\\nconcealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt\\nbefore. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.\\n\\nFortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the\\nconversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a\\nfew minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was\\nthen at liberty to think and be wretched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\n\\nHowever small Elinor\\'s general dependence on Lucy\\'s veracity might be,\\nit was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the\\npresent case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of\\ninventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to\\nbe true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt;\\nsupported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and\\nproofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their\\nopportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation\\nfor the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward\\'s visit\\nnear Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at\\nhis own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the\\nintimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family\\nconnections, which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,\\nthe ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame\\nevery fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact,\\nwhich no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself. Her\\nresentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,\\nfor a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas,\\nother considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally\\ndeceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?\\nWas his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it\\nmight once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His\\naffection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her\\nmother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her\\nat Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly\\nloved her. What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! How much\\ncould it not tempt her to forgive! He had been blamable, highly\\nblamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence\\nover him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be\\ndefended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured\\nhimself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence\\nhad made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived\\nhimself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in time\\nregain tranquillity; but _he_, what had he to look forward to? Could\\nhe ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his\\naffection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his\\ndelicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like\\nher--illiterate, artful, and selfish?\\n\\nThe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to\\nevery thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding\\nyears--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the\\nunderstanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,\\nwhile the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society\\nand more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity\\nwhich might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.\\n\\nIf in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his\\ndifficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were\\nthey now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was\\nundoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune\\nto herself. These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated\\nfrom Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy\\nwas the state of the person by whom the expectation of family\\nopposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!\\n\\nAs these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she\\nwept for him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of\\nhaving done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by\\nthe belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she\\nthought she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow,\\ncommand herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her\\nmother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own\\nexpectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after\\nshe had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one\\nwould have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor\\nwas mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\\nfrom the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling\\non the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly\\npossessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove\\nnear their house.\\n\\nThe necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had\\nbeen entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to\\nunceasing exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor\\'s distress. On the\\ncontrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of\\nwhat would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from\\nhearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from\\nthe excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more\\nthan she felt equal to support.\\n\\nFrom their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive\\nno assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,\\nwhile her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their\\nexample nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own\\ngood sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,\\nher appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so\\npoignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.\\n\\nMuch as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the\\nsubject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for\\nmore reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their\\nengagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what\\nLucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her\\ndeclaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to\\nconvince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her\\ncalmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in\\nit than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary\\nagitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least\\ndoubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very\\nprobable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her\\npraise, not merely from Lucy\\'s assertion, but from her venturing to\\ntrust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so\\nconfessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John\\'s joking\\nintelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor\\nremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by\\nEdward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it\\nnatural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very\\nconfidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the\\naffair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of\\nLucy\\'s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in\\nfuture? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her\\nrival\\'s intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as\\nevery principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own\\naffection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could\\nnot deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her\\nheart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to\\nhear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust\\nher own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with\\ncomposure.\\n\\nBut it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be\\ncommanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take\\nadvantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine\\nenough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most\\neasily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at\\nleast every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly\\nat the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of\\nconversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or\\nLady Middleton\\'s head; and therefore very little leisure was ever\\ngiven for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.\\nThey met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together,\\nplaying at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was\\nsufficiently noisy.\\n\\nOne or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording\\nElinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at\\nthe cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they\\nwould all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to\\nattend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,\\nexcept her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a\\nfairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this\\nwas likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\nand well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united\\nthem together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the\\ninvitation; Margaret, with her mother\\'s permission, was equally\\ncompliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their\\nparties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\\n\\nThe young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from\\nthe frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the\\nmeeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one\\nnovelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less\\ninteresting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining\\nparlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied\\nthem, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the\\nimpossibility of engaging Lucy\\'s attention to attempt it. They quitted\\nit only with the removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then\\nplaced, and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\\nentertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. They\\nall rose up in preparation for a round game.\\n\\n\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy, \"you are not going to finish\\npoor little Annamaria\\'s basket this evening; for I am sure it must\\nhurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the\\ndear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and\\nthen I hope she will not much mind it.\"\\n\\nThis hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,\\n\"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting\\nto know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have\\nbeen at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel\\nfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am\\nresolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\\n\\n\"You are very good, I hope it won\\'t hurt your eyes:--will you ring the\\nbell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly\\ndisappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for\\nthough I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon\\nhaving it done.\"\\n\\nLucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with\\nan alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could\\ntaste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt\\nchild.\\n\\nLady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made\\nany objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the\\nforms of general civility, exclaimed, \"Your Ladyship will have the\\ngoodness to excuse _me_--you know I detest cards. I shall go to the\\npiano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned.\" And without\\nfarther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\\n\\nLady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that _she_ had never\\nmade so rude a speech.\\n\\n\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma\\'am,\"\\nsaid Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; \"and I do not\\nmuch wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever\\nheard.\"\\n\\nThe remaining five were now to draw their cards.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen to cut out, I may be\\nof some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and\\nthere is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be\\nimpossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I\\nshould like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,\" cried\\nLucy, \"for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there\\nwas; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria\\nafter all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele. \"Dear little\\nsoul, how I do love her!\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor; \"and as you\\nreally like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut\\nin till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?\"\\n\\nElinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by\\na little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to\\npractise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same\\ntime. Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair\\nrivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\\nutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at\\nwhich Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had\\nby this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,\\nwas luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might\\nsafely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\\nsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\n\\nIn a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\\n\\n\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,\\nif I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on\\nits subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking the ice; you have set my\\nheart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended\\nyou by what I told you that Monday.\"\\n\\n\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\" and Elinor spoke\\nit with the truest sincerity, \"nothing could be farther from my\\nintention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for\\nthe trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\\n\\n\"And yet I do assure you,\" replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of\\nmeaning, \"there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your\\nmanner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was\\nangry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for\\nhaving took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am\\nvery glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not\\nblame me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my\\nheart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of\\nmy life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am\\nsure.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,\\nto acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall\\nnever have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one;\\nyou seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have\\nneed of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr.\\nFerrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\\n\\n\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to\\nmarry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every\\nprospect of more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very\\nsmall income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love\\nhim too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all\\nthat his mother might give him if he married to please her. We must\\nwait, it may be for many years. With almost every other man in the\\nworld, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward\\'s affection and\\nconstancy nothing can deprive me of I know.\"\\n\\n\"That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly\\nsupported by the same trust in your\\'s. If the strength of your\\nreciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under\\nmany circumstances it naturally would during a four years\\' engagement,\\nyour situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\"\\n\\nLucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her\\ncountenance from every expression that could give her words a\\nsuspicious tendency.\\n\\n\"Edward\\'s love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty well put to the\\ntest, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and\\nit has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt\\nit now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment\\'s alarm\\non that account from the first.\"\\n\\nElinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.\\n\\nLucy went on. \"I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from\\nour different situations in life, from his being so much more in the\\nworld than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for\\nsuspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had\\nbeen the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or\\nany lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had\\ntalked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less\\nhappy at Longstaple than he used to be. I do not mean to say that I am\\nparticularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\\nI am sure I could not be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"All this,\" thought Elinor, \"is very pretty; but it can impose upon\\nneither of us.\"\\n\\n\"But what,\" said she after a short silence, \"are your views? or have\\nyou none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars\\'s death, which is a\\nmelancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to\\nthis, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in\\nwhich it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure\\nfor a while by owning the truth?\"\\n\\n\"If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs.\\nFerrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of\\nanger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,\\nand the idea of that, for Edward\\'s sake, frightens away all my\\ninclination for hasty measures.\"\\n\\n\"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness\\nbeyond reason.\"\\n\\nLucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.\\n\\n\"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\" asked Elinor.\\n\\n\"Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his\\nbrother--silly and a great coxcomb.\"\\n\\n\"A great coxcomb!\" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those\\nwords by a sudden pause in Marianne\\'s music. \"Oh, they are talking of\\ntheir favourite beaux, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No sister,\" cried Lucy, \"you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux\\nare _not_ great coxcombs.\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood\\'s is not,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\nlaughing heartily; \"for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved\\nyoung men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little\\ncreature, there is no finding out who _she_ likes.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I can answer for it,\" said Mrs. Jennings._]\\n\\n\"Oh,\" cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, \"I dare\\nsay Lucy\\'s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss\\nDashwood\\'s.\"\\n\\nElinor blushed in spite of herself. Lucy bit her lip, and looked\\nangrily at her sister. A mutual silence took place for some time. Lucy\\nfirst put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was\\nthen giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent\\nconcerto--\\n\\n\"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my\\nhead, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into\\nthe secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seen\\nenough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\\nother profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as\\nhe can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be\\nkind enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some\\nregard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland\\nliving; which I understand is a very good one, and the present\\nincumbent not likely to live a great while. That would be enough for\\nus to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.\"\\n\\n\"I should always be happy,\" replied Elinor, \"to show any mark of my\\nesteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my\\ninterest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He is\\nbrother to Mrs. John Dashwood--_that_ must be recommendation enough to\\nher husband.\"\\n\\n\"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward\\'s going into\\norders.\"\\n\\n\"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.\"\\n\\nThey were again silent for many minutes. At length Lucy exclaimed with\\na deep sigh--\\n\\n\"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at\\nonce by dissolving the engagement. We seem so beset with difficulties\\non every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we\\nshould be happier perhaps in the end. But you will not give me your\\nadvice, Miss Dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated\\nfeelings, \"on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well\\nthat my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the\\nside of your wishes.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you wrong me,\" replied Lucy, with great solemnity; \"I know\\nnobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do\\nreally believe, that if you was to say to me, \\'I advise you by all\\nmeans to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be\\nmore for the happiness of both of you,\\' I should resolve upon doing it\\nimmediately.\"\\n\\nElinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward\\'s future wife, and\\nreplied, \"This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving\\nany opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence\\nmuch too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\\nis too much for an indifferent person.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said Lucy, with some\\npique, and laying a particular stress on those words, \"that your\\njudgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be\\nsupposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your\\nopinion would not be worth having.\"\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might\\nprovoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve;\\nand was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.\\nAnother pause therefore of many minutes\\' duration, succeeded this\\nspeech, and Lucy was still the first to end it.\\n\\n\"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\" said she with all\\nher accustomary complacency.\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for that,\" returned the other, while her eyes brightened\\nat the information, \"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you\\nthere! But I dare say you will go for all that. To be sure, your\\nbrother and sister will ask you to come to them.\"\\n\\n\"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.\"\\n\\n\"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.\\nAnne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who\\nhave been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go\\nfor the sake of seeing Edward. He will be there in February, otherwise\\nLondon would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\"\\n\\nElinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the\\nfirst rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was\\ntherefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any\\nreluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them\\ndislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down\\nto the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not\\nonly without affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that\\nhe had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which\\nsincere affection on _her_ side would have given, for self-interest\\nalone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which\\nshe seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary.\\n\\nFrom this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when\\nentered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing\\nit, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her\\nhappiness whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated\\nby the former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as\\ncivility would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an\\nindulgence which Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to\\nherself.\\n\\nThe visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond\\nwhat the first invitation implied. Their favour increased; they could\\nnot be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of\\ntheir numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of\\nthe absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which\\nwas in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to\\nstay nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due\\ncelebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share\\nof private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\n\\nThough Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of\\nthe year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not\\nwithout a settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her\\nhusband, who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the\\ntown, she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets\\nnear Portman Square. Towards this home, she began on the approach of\\nJanuary to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and\\nvery unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to\\naccompany her. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her\\nsister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan,\\nimmediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\\nbelieved herself to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason\\nalleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at\\nthat time of the year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some\\nsurprise, and repeated her invitation immediately.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I _do_\\nbeg you will favour me with your company, for I\\'ve quite set my heart\\nupon it. Don\\'t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I\\nshan\\'t put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be\\nsending Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford _that._ We three\\nshall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,\\nif you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always\\ngo with one of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to\\nit; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my\\nhands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of\\nyou; and if I don\\'t get one of you at least well married before I have\\ndone with you, it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for\\nyou to all the young men, you may depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne would not object\\nto such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very\\nhard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss\\nDashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for\\ntown, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss\\nDashwood about it.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of\\nMiss Marianne\\'s company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only\\nthe more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable\\nfor them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might\\ntalk to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back. But one\\nor the other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do\\nyou think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used\\ntill this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let\\nus strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her\\nmind by and bye, why so much the better.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, ma\\'am, sincerely thank you,\" said Marianne, with warmth:\\n\"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give\\nme such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,\\nto be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I\\nfeel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made\\nless happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should\\ntempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare\\nthem perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and\\nsaw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by\\nher eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\\nopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother\\'s\\ndecision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any\\nsupport in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not\\napprove of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had\\nparticular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her\\nmother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence\\nthe latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which\\nshe had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared\\nnot explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London.\\nThat Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.\\nJennings\\' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook\\nevery inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be\\nmost wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,\\nwas such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object\\nto her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared\\nto witness.\\n\\nOn being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that\\nsuch an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her\\ndaughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to\\nherself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of\\ntheir declining the offer upon _her_ account; insisted on their both\\naccepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual\\ncheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,\\nfrom this separation.\\n\\n\"I am delighted with the plan,\" she cried, \"it is exactly what I could\\nwish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.\\nWhen you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and\\nhappily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret\\nso improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of\\nalteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without\\nany inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you _should_ go to\\ntown; I would have every young woman of your condition in life\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be\\nunder the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to\\nyou I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your\\nbrother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,\\nwhen I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly\\nestranged from each other.\"\\n\\n\"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\" said Elinor, \"you\\nhave been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which\\noccurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,\\ncannot be so easily removed.\"\\n\\nMarianne\\'s countenance sunk.\\n\\n\"And what,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, \"is my dear prudent Elinor going to\\nsuggest? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? Do not\\nlet me hear a word about the expense of it.\"\\n\\n\"My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nheart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or\\nwhose protection will give us consequence.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" replied her mother, \"but of her society,\\nseparately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing\\nat all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady\\nMiddleton.\"\\n\\n\"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,\" said\\nMarianne, \"at least it need not prevent _my_ accepting her invitation.\\nI have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every\\nunpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.\"\\n\\nElinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards\\nthe manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in\\npersuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved\\nwithin herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go\\nlikewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left\\nto the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should\\nbe abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her\\ndomestic hours. To this determination she was the more easily\\nreconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy\\'s account,\\nwas not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without\\nany unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.\\n\\n\"I will have you _both_ go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood; \"these objections are\\nnonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and\\nespecially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to\\nanticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of\\nsources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\\nacquaintance with her sister-in-law\\'s family.\"\\n\\nElinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her\\nmother\\'s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the\\nshock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on\\nthis attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to\\nbegin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward\\nFerrars very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the\\nrest of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me,\\nwhether I am ever known to them or not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in\\nastonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held\\nher tongue.\\n\\nAfter very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the\\ninvitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the\\ninformation with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness\\nand care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was\\ndelighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of\\nbeing alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in\\nLondon, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being\\ndelighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as\\nfor the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in\\ntheir lives as this intelligence made them.\\n\\nElinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with\\nless reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself,\\nit was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and\\nwhen she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her\\nsister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all\\nher usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she\\ncould not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow\\nherself to distrust the consequence.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the\\nperturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her\\nunwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;\\nand at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.\\nHer mother\\'s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one\\nof the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short\\nof eternal.\\n\\nTheir departure took place in the first week in January. The\\nMiddletons were to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their\\nstation at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the\\nfamily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\n\\nElinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and\\nbeginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,\\nwithout wondering at her own situation, so short had their\\nacquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age\\nand disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a\\nmeasure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with\\nthat happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally\\nshared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every\\noccasional doubt of Willoughby\\'s constancy, could not witness the\\nrapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and\\nbeamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own\\nprospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and\\nhow gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne\\'s situation\\nto have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of\\nhope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what\\nWilloughby\\'s intentions were; in all probability he was already in\\ntown. Marianne\\'s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on\\nfinding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every\\nnew light as to his character which her own observation or the\\nintelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his\\nbehaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain\\nwhat he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\\nShould the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was\\ndetermined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be\\notherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature--she must then\\nlearn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which\\nmight lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.\\n\\nThey were three days on their journey, and Marianne\\'s behaviour as\\nthey travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and\\ncompanionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in\\nsilence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\\never voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\\nbeauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight\\nexclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct\\ntherefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility\\nwhich she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to\\nMrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\\nwhenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both\\nwith all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their\\nease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them\\nchoose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\\npreferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They\\nreached town by three o\\'clock the third day, glad to be released,\\nafter such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to\\nenjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\\n\\nThe house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young\\nladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable\\napartment. It had formerly been Charlotte\\'s, and over the mantelpiece\\nstill hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof\\nof her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some\\neffect.\\n\\nAs dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\\narrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\\nmother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did\\nthe same. \"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two?\"\\n\\n\"I am _not_ going to write to my mother,\" replied Marianne, hastily,\\nand as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more;\\nit immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;\\nand the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\\nmysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\\nengaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\\npleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\\nMarianne\\'s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be\\nno more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\\neager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\\ndirection; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\\nbell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter\\nconveyed for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at\\nonce.\\n\\nHer spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\\nwhich prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\\nagitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any\\ndinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\\nanxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\\n\\nIt was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being\\nmuch engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.\\nThe tea things were brought in, and already had Marianne been\\ndisappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a\\nloud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any\\nother house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby\\'s\\napproach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every\\nthing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened\\nthe door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening\\nhalf a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a\\nconviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy\\nof her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, \"Oh,\\nElinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed almost ready to\\nthrow herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.\\n\\nIt was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she\\nimmediately left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the\\nsame time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her;\\nand she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister\\nshould perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and\\ndisappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not\\nunnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the\\nroom, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the\\nrecollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\\n\\n\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\\n\\nElinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\\nhead-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to\\nwhich she could decently attribute her sister\\'s behaviour.\\n\\nHe heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\\nhimself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\\nhis pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries\\nabout their journey, and the friends they had left behind.\\n\\nIn this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\\nthey continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\\nof both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether\\nWilloughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\\nany enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying\\nsomething, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen\\nhim last. \"Yes,\" he replied, with some embarrassment, \"almost ever\\nsince; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it\\nhas never been in my power to return to Barton.\"\\n\\nThis, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\\nher remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\\nthe uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and\\nshe was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on\\nthe subject than she had ever felt.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon came in. \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she, with her usual\\nnoisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not\\ncome before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me\\na little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have\\nbeen at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things\\nto do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had\\nCartwright to settle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever\\nsince dinner! But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I\\nshould be in town today?\"\\n\\n\"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer\\'s, where I have been\\ndining.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does\\nCharlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,\\nthat you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two\\nyoung ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,\\nbut there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which\\nyou will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr.\\nWilloughby will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be\\nyoung and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very\\nhandsome--worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I\\ndon\\'t know what the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has\\nbeen dead these eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you\\nbeen to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come,\\nlet\\'s have no secrets among friends.\"\\n\\nHe replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but\\nwithout satisfying her in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and\\nMarianne was obliged to appear again.\\n\\nAfter her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent\\nthan he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to\\nstay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were\\nunanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\\n\\nMarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.\\nThe disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the\\nexpectation of what was to happen that day. They had not long finished\\ntheir breakfast before Mrs. Palmer\\'s barouche stopped at the door, and\\nin a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see\\nthem all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure\\nfrom meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at\\ntheir coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all\\nalong; so angry at their accepting her mother\\'s invitation after\\nhaving declined her own, though at the same time she would never have\\nforgiven them if they had not come!\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\" said she; \"What do you think\\nhe said when he heard of your coming with Mamma? I forget what it was\\nnow, but it was something so droll!\"\\n\\nAfter an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,\\nor in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their\\nacquaintance on Mrs. Jennings\\'s side, and in laughter without cause on\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s, it was proposed by the latter that they should all\\naccompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to\\nwhich Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise\\nsome purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it\\nat first was induced to go likewise.\\n\\nWherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond\\nStreet especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in\\nconstant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her\\nmind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\\nfrom all that interested and occupied the others. Restless and\\ndissatisfied every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of\\nany article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both:\\nshe received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\\nhome again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the\\ntediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing\\npretty, expensive, or new; who was wild to buy all, could determine on\\nnone, and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision.\\n\\nIt was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner\\nhad they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and\\nwhen Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a\\nsorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been\\nthere.\\n\\n\"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\" said she to\\nthe footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the\\nnegative. \"Are you quite sure of it?\" she replied. \"Are you certain\\nthat no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?\"\\n\\nThe man replied that none had.\\n\\n\"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she\\nturned away to the window.\\n\\n\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her\\nsister with uneasiness. \"If she had not known him to be in town she\\nwould not have written to him, as she did; she would have written to\\nCombe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come\\nnor write! Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an\\nengagement between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be\\ncarried on in so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire;\\nand how will _my_ interference be borne.\"\\n\\nShe determined, after some consideration, that if appearances\\ncontinued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would\\nrepresent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some\\nserious enquiry into the affair.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings\\'s intimate\\nacquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with\\nthem. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening\\nengagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\nfor the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she\\nwould never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her\\nown disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure\\nto her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of\\nexpectation and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured\\nfor a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she\\nreturned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and\\nforwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to\\nthe window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\n\\n\"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings, when\\nthey met at breakfast the following morning, \"Sir John will not like\\nleaving Barton next week; \\'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a\\nday\\'s pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem\\nto take it so much to heart.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to\\nthe window as she spoke, to examine the day. \"I had not thought of\\nthat. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.\"\\n\\nIt was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.\\n\"It is charming weather for _them_ indeed,\" she continued, as she sat\\ndown to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. \"How much they\\nmust enjoy it! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot be\\nexpected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a\\nseries of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts\\nwill soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day\\nor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,\\nperhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\\n\\n\"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from\\nseeing her sister\\'s thoughts as clearly as she did, \"I dare say we\\nshall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next\\nweek.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, my dear, I\\'ll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way.\"\\n\\n\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will write to Combe by\\nthis day\\'s post.\"\\n\\nBut if she _did_, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy\\nwhich eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the\\ntruth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough\\ncontentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could\\nnot be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy\\nin the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation\\nof a frost.\\n\\nThe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.\\nJennings\\'s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and\\nMarianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,\\nwatching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the\\nair.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There\\nseems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm\\neven in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem\\nparting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\\nclear afternoon.\"\\n\\nElinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,\\nand saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning\\nin the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of\\napproaching frost.\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.\\nJennings\\'s style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her\\nbehaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her\\nhousehold arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and\\nexcepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton\\'s regret,\\nshe had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction\\ncould at all discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased\\nto find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she\\nhad expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much\\nreal enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at\\nhome or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with\\nthem almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,\\nwho often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from\\nany other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much\\nconcern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a\\nstrengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which\\nhe often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than\\nwhen at Barton.\\n\\nAbout a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby\\nwas also arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the\\nmorning\\'s drive.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while we were out.\"\\nElinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured\\nto say, \"Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.\" But Marianne\\nseemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings\\'s entrance, escaped\\nwith the precious card.\\n\\nThis event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those\\nof her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From\\nthis moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him\\nevery hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on\\nbeing left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.\\n\\nElinor\\'s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley\\nStreet during their absence; but a moment\\'s glance at her sister when\\nthey returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no\\nsecond visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the\\ntable.\\n\\n\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, for my mistress.\"\\n\\nBut Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\\n\\n\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\\n\\n\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor, unable to be longer\\nsilent.\\n\\n\"Yes, a little--not much.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause. \"You have no confidence in me, Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from _you_--you who have confidence in no\\none!\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed, Marianne, I have\\nnothing to tell.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations then are\\nalike. We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do\\nnot communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.\"\\n\\nElinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was\\nnot at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to\\npress for greater openness in Marianne.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it\\naloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit\\nStreet the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and\\ncousins the following evening. Business on Sir John\\'s part, and a\\nviolent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.\\nThe invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew\\nnear, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that\\nthey should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\\ndifficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen\\nnothing of Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for\\namusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again\\nin her absence.\\n\\nElinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not\\nmaterially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled\\nin town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\\nyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,\\nhowever, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an\\nunpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the\\nreputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it\\nwas risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it\\nknown that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine\\ncouple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had\\nnot seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to\\navoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and\\ntherefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on\\ntheir entrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\\nwho they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side\\nof the room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she\\nentered: it was enough--_he_ was not there--and she sat down, equally\\nill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been\\nassembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss\\nDashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town, though\\nColonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house,\\nand he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were\\nto come.\\n\\n\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\\n\\n\"When do you go back again?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\\n\\nNever had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was\\nthat evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She\\ncomplained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason of all that very\\nwell; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you\\nwould not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very\\npretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\\n\\n\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him\\nsomewhere in the street this morning.\" Marianne said no more, but\\nlooked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing\\nsomething that might lead to her sister\\'s relief, Elinor resolved to\\nwrite the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears\\nfor the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been\\nso long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\\nby perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again\\nwriting to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other\\nperson.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on\\nbusiness, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too\\nrestless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one\\nwindow to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\\nElinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all\\nthat had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby\\'s inconstancy, urging\\nher by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an\\naccount of her real situation with respect to him.\\n\\nHer letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and\\nColonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him from the\\nwindow, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he\\nentered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\\nsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in\\nparticular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.\\nElinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her\\nsister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the\\nfirst time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than\\nonce before, beginning with the observation of \"your sister looks\\nunwell to-day,\" or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had\\nappeared on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\\nsomething particular about her. After a pause of several minutes,\\ntheir silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some\\nagitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a\\nbrother? Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and having no\\nanswer ready, was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient, of\\nasking what he meant? He tried to smile as he replied, \"your sister\\'s\\nengagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known.\"\\n\\n\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor, \"for her own family\\ndo not know it.\"\\n\\nHe looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon, I am afraid my\\ninquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy\\nintended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally\\ntalked of.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?\"\\n\\n\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you\\nare most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But\\nstill I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps\\nrather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to\\nsupport its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in\\nyour sister\\'s writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I\\ncould ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it\\nimpossible to-? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of\\nsucceeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in\\nsaying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I\\nhave the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely\\nresolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if\\nconcealment be possible, is all that remains.\"\\n\\nThese words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for\\nher sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able to\\nsay anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated\\nfor a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The\\nreal state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little\\nknown to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as\\nliable to say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced that\\nMarianne\\'s affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and\\nat the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she\\nthought it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say\\nmore than she really knew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore,\\nthat though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on\\nwhich they stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no\\ndoubt, and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.\\n\\nHe listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,\\nrose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,\\n\"to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\\nmay endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\\n\\nElinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to\\nlessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on\\nthe contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon\\'s\\nunhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her\\nanxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\n\\n\\nNothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor\\nregret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby\\nneither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time\\nto attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept\\naway by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this\\nparty, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and\\nseeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared,\\nwithout one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the\\ndrawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton\\'s\\narrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her\\nattitude, lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister\\'s\\npresence; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited\\nfor them at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one\\nwas expected.\\n\\nThey arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as\\nthe string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended\\nthe stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to\\nanother in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\\nquite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their\\ntribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were\\npermitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and\\ninconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some\\ntime spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to\\nCassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and\\nElinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great\\ndistance from the table.\\n\\nThey had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived\\nWilloughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest\\nconversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She soon\\ncaught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to\\nspeak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see\\nher; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor\\nturned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be\\nunobserved by her. At that moment she first perceived him, and her\\nwhole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved\\ntowards him instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he is there--Oh! why does\\nhe not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?\"\\n\\n\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do not betray what you\\nfeel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\"\\n\\nThis however was more than she could believe herself; and to be\\ncomposed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne,\\nit was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which\\naffected every feature.\\n\\n[Illustration: _At that moment she first perceived him._]\\n\\nAt last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,\\nand pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to\\nhim. He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than\\nMarianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to\\nobserve her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs.\\nDashwood, and asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed\\nof all presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a\\nword. But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her\\nface was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest\\nemotion, \"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you\\nnot received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?\"\\n\\nHe could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and\\nhe held her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was\\nevidently struggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and\\nsaw its expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment\\'s pause, he\\nspoke with calmness.\\n\\n\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,\\nand very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find\\nyourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope.\"\\n\\n\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne in the wildest\\nanxiety. \"Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake. What\\ncan be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven\\'s sake tell\\nme, what is the matter?\"\\n\\nHe made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment\\nreturned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom\\nhe had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant\\nexertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had\\nthe pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town,\\nwhich you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away with a\\nslight bow and joined his friend.\\n\\nMarianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into\\nher chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried\\nto screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with\\nlavender water.\\n\\n\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she could speak, \"and force\\nhim to come to me. Tell him I must see him again--must speak to him\\ninstantly. I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment\\'s peace till this\\nis explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him\\nthis moment.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is\\nnot the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow.\"\\n\\nWith difficulty however could she prevent her from following him\\nherself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at\\nleast, with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him\\nwith more privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne\\ncontinued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her\\nfeelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw\\nWilloughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and\\ntelling Marianne that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking\\nto him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She\\ninstantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them\\nhome, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer.\\n\\nLady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed\\nthat Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her\\nwish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they\\ndeparted as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was\\nspoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a\\nsilent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings\\nwas luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,\\nwhere hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon\\nundressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her\\nsister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs.\\nJennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past.\\n\\nThat some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and\\nMarianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,\\nseemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own\\nwishes, _she_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or\\nmisapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of\\nsentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been still\\nstronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which\\nseemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented\\nher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with\\nthe affections of her sister from the first, without any design that\\nwould bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and\\nconvenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a\\nregard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.\\n\\nAs for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already\\nhave given her, and on those still more severe which might await her\\nin its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest\\nconcern. Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\\ncould _esteem_ Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided\\nin future, her mind might be always supported. But every circumstance\\nthat could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery\\nof Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and\\nirreconcilable rupture with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\n\\n\\nBefore the housemaid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun\\ngained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne,\\nonly half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for\\nthe sake of all the little light she could command from it, and\\nwriting as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her. In this\\nsituation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first\\nperceived her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent\\nanxiety, said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness--\\n\\n\"Marianne, may I ask--\"\\n\\n\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will soon know all.\"\\n\\nThe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no\\nlonger than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return\\nof the same excessive affliction. It was some minutes before she could\\ngo on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still\\nobliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of\\nher feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the\\nlast time to Willoughby.\\n\\nElinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power;\\nand she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had\\nnot Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous\\nirritability, not to speak to her for the world. In such\\ncircumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long\\ntogether; and the restless state of Marianne\\'s mind not only prevented\\nher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but\\nrequiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her\\nwander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of\\nevery body.\\n\\nAt breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and\\nElinor\\'s attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in\\npitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to\\nengage Mrs. Jennings\\'s notice entirely to herself.\\n\\nAs this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a\\nconsiderable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,\\nround the common working table, when a letter was delivered to\\nMarianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a\\ndeath-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. Elinor, who saw as\\nplainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come\\nfrom Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her\\nhardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremor as\\nmade her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings\\'s notice. That\\ngood lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from\\nWilloughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she\\ntreated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it\\nto her liking. Of Elinor\\'s distress, she was too busily employed in\\nmeasuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and\\ncalmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my\\nlife! _My_ girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish\\nenough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. I\\nhope, from the bottom of my heart, he won\\'t keep her waiting much\\nlonger, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.\\nPray, when are they to be married?\"\\n\\nElinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,\\nobliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,\\ntrying to smile, replied, \"And have you really, Ma\\'am, talked yourself\\ninto a persuasion of my sister\\'s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I\\nthought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to\\nimply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive\\nyourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me\\nmore than to hear of their being going to be married.\"\\n\\n\"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so? Don\\'t we\\nall know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in\\nlove with each other from the first moment they met? Did not I see\\nthem together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I\\nknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding\\nclothes? Come, come, this won\\'t do. Because you are so sly about it\\nyourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such\\nthing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever\\nso long. I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, very seriously, \"you are mistaken.\\nIndeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and\\nyou will find that you have though you will not believe me now.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,\\nand eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried\\naway to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne\\nstretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\\nand two or three others laying by her. Elinor drew near, but without\\nsaying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed\\nher affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of\\ntears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne\\'s. The\\nlatter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of\\nthis behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction,\\nshe put all the letters into Elinor\\'s hands; and then covering her\\nface with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who\\nknew that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its\\ncourse, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\\nspent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby\\'s letter, read as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n\"Bond Street, January.\\n\\n\"MY DEAR MADAM,\\n\\n     \"I have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for\\n     which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments. I am much\\n     concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last\\n     night that did not meet your approbation; and though I am\\n     quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so\\n     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of\\n     what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional.\\n     I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your\\n     family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and\\n     flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\\n     misapprehension of my actions. My esteem for your whole\\n     family is very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate as\\n     to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, or meant to\\n     express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more\\n     guarded in my professions of that esteem. That I should ever\\n     have meant more you will allow to be impossible, when you\\n     understand that my affections have been long engaged\\n     elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before\\n     this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I\\n     obey your commands in returning the letters with which I\\n     have been honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you\\n     so obligingly bestowed on me.\\n\\nI am, dear Madam,\\n\\nYour most obedient humble servant,\\n\\n\"JOHN WILLOUGHBY.\"\\n\\nWith what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss\\nDashwood, may be imagined. Though aware, before she began it, that it\\nmust bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their\\nseparation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be\\nsuffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby\\ncapable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable\\nand delicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman,\\nas to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of\\nbringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret,\\nacknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection\\nwhatever;--a letter of which every line was an insult, and which\\nproclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.\\n\\nShe paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then\\nread it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase\\nher abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against\\nhim, that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound\\nMarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss\\nto her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most\\nirremediable of all evils,--a connection, for life, with an\\nunprincipled man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most\\nimportant.\\n\\nIn her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the\\ndepravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the\\nvery different mind of a very different person, who had no other\\nconnection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with\\nevery thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her\\nsister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and\\nso entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on\\nhearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see\\nwho could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to\\nperceive Mrs. Jennings\\'s chariot, which she knew had not been ordered\\ntill one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of\\ncontributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse\\nherself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being\\nindisposed. Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for\\nits cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing\\nher safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise\\nfrom the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from\\nfalling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest\\nand food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many\\nnights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no\\nlonger supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this\\nwas felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous\\nfaintness. A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,\\nmade her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some\\nsense of her kindness, by saying, \"Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make\\nyou!\"\\n\\n\"I only wish,\" replied her sister, \"there were any thing I _could_ do,\\nwhich might be of comfort to you.\"\\n\\nThis, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,\\nwho could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, \"Oh! Elinor, I\\nam miserable, indeed,\" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.\\n\\nElinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in\\nsilence.\\n\\n\"Exert yourself, dear Marianne,\" she cried, \"if you would not kill\\nyourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her\\nmisery while _you_ suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot, I cannot,\" cried Marianne; \"leave me, leave me, if I\\ndistress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so.\\nOh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of\\nexertion! Happy, happy Elinor, _you_ cannot have an idea of what I\\nsuffer.\"\\n\\n\"Do you call _me_ happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew! And can you\\nbelieve me to be so, while I see you so wretched!\"\\n\\n\"Forgive me, forgive me,\" throwing her arms round her sister\\'s neck;\\n\"I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you\\nare--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away\\nsuch happiness as that?\"\\n\\n\"Many, many circumstances,\" said Elinor, solemnly.\\n\\n\"No, no, no,\" cried Marianne wildly, \"he loves you, and only you. You\\n_can_ have no grief.\"\\n\\n\"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.\"\\n\\n\"And you will never see me otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing\\ncan do away.\"\\n\\n\"You must not talk so, Marianne. Have you no comforts? no friends? Is\\nyour loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you\\nsuffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of\\nhis character had been delayed to a later period;--if your engagement\\nhad been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,\\nbefore he chose to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy\\nconfidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"Engagement!\" cried Marianne, \"there has been no engagement.\"\\n\\n\"No engagement!\"\\n\\n\"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith\\nwith me.\"\\n\\n\"But he told you that he loved you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--no--never absolutely. It was every day implied, but never\\nprofessedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been--but it never\\nwas.\"\\n\\n\"Yet you wrote to him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes: could that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot\\ntalk.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now\\nraised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the\\ncontents of all. The first, which was what her sister had sent him on\\ntheir arrival in town, was to this effect:--\\n\\n\"Berkeley Street, January.\\n\\n     \"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this;\\n     and I think you will feel something more than surprise, when\\n     you know that I am in town. An opportunity of coming hither,\\n     though with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation we could not\\n     resist. I wish you may receive this in time to come here\\n     tonight, but I will not depend on it. At any rate I shall\\n     expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.\\n\\nM.D.\"\\n\\nHer second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance\\nat the Middletons\\', was in these words:--\\n\\n     \"I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the\\n     day before yesterday, nor my astonishment at not having\\n     received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week\\n     ago. I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more\\n     to see you, every hour of the day. Pray call again as soon\\n     as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected\\n     this in vain. You had better come earlier another time,\\n     because we are generally out by one. We were last night at\\n     Lady Middleton\\'s, where there was a dance. I have been told\\n     that you were asked to be of the party. But could it be so?\\n     You must be very much altered indeed since we parted, if\\n     that could be the case, and you not there. But I will not\\n     suppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your\\n     personal assurance of its being otherwise.\\n\\nM.D.\"\\n\\nThe contents of her last note to him were these:--\\n\\n     \"What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last\\n     night? Again I demand an explanation of it. I was prepared\\n     to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally\\n     produced,--with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton\\n     appeared to me to justify. I was repulsed indeed! I have\\n     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct\\n     which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though\\n     I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for\\n     your behaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your\\n     justification of it. You have perhaps been misinformed, or\\n     purposely deceived, in something concerning me, which may\\n     have lowered me in your opinion. Tell me what it is, explain\\n     the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be satisfied, in\\n     being able to satisfy you. It would grieve me indeed to be\\n     obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am\\n     to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed\\n     you, that your regard for us all was insincere, that your\\n     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let it be told\\n     as soon as possible. My feelings are at present in a state\\n     of dreadful indecision; I wish to acquit you, but certainty\\n     on either side will be ease to what I now suffer. If your\\n     sentiments are no longer what they were, you will return my\\n     notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.\\n\\nM.D.\"\\n\\nThat such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have\\nbeen so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby\\'s sake, would have been\\nunwilling to believe. But her condemnation of him did not blind her to\\nthe impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was\\nsilently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such\\nunsolicited proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,\\nand most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving\\nthat she had finished the letters, observed to her that they contained\\nnothing but what any one would have written in the same situation.\\n\\n\"I felt myself,\" she added, \"to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if\\nthe strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.\"\\n\\n\"I can believe it,\" said Elinor; \"but unfortunately he did not feel\\nthe same.\"\\n\\n\"He _did_ feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it. I\\nknow he did. Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the\\nblackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear\\nto him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can\\nso readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest\\nsupplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his\\nvoice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being\\ntogether at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he told me\\nthat it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I\\never forget his distress?\"\\n\\nFor a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had\\npassed away, she added, in a firmer tone--\\n\\n\"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Marianne, who but himself? By whom can he have been\\ninstigated?\"\\n\\n\"By all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather\\nbelieve every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me\\nin his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This\\nwoman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but\\nyour own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to\\nbely me. Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I\\nwould not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know\\nso well?\"\\n\\nElinor would not contend, and only replied, \"Whoever may have been so\\ndetestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,\\nmy dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\\ninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a\\nreasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" cried Marianne, \"misery such as mine has no pride. I care\\nnot who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be\\nopen to all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be\\nproud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return\\nmortification--but I cannot. I must feel--I must be wretched--and they\\nare welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.\"\\n\\n\"But for my mother\\'s sake and mine--\"\\n\\n\"I would do more than for my own. But to appear happy when I am so\\nmiserable--oh! who can require it?\"\\n\\nAgain they were both silent. Elinor was employed in walking\\nthoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,\\nwithout knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning\\nobjects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the\\nbed, with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up\\nWilloughby\\'s letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n\"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!\\nCruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever he\\nmight have heard against me, ought he not to have suspended his\\nbelief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power\\nof clearing myself? \\'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)\\nwhich you so obligingly bestowed on me\\'--that is unpardonable.\\nWilloughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh,\\nbarbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?\"\\n\\n\"No, Marianne, in no possible way.\"\\n\\n\"And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long\\nit may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who\\nis she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young\\nand attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one:--he\\ntalked to me only of myself.\"\\n\\nAnother pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended\\nthus:--\\n\\n\"Elinor, I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be\\ngone to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow, Marianne!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby\\'s sake--and\\nnow who cares for me? Who regards me?\"\\n\\n\"It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much\\nmore than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent\\nsuch a hasty removal as that.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long,\\nI cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.\\nThe Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity? The pity of\\nsuch a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would _he_ say to that!\"\\n\\nElinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but\\nno attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body\\nshe moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more\\nhysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at\\nall, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for\\nassistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length\\npersuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings\\nreturned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and\\nwithout waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the\\ndoor and walked in with a look of real concern.\\n\\n\"How do you do my dear?\" said she in a voice of great compassion to\\nMarianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.\\n\\n\"How is she, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! she looks very bad. No\\nwonder. Ay, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon--a\\ngood-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told\\nme of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend\\nof Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;\\nand I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say\\nis, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance\\nabominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his\\nheart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I\\nhave no notion of men\\'s going on in this way; and if ever I meet him\\nagain, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a\\nday. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne--he is not the\\nonly young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face\\nyou will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won\\'t disturb her\\nany longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done\\nwith. The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know,\\nand that will amuse her.\"\\n\\nShe then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she\\nsupposed her young friend\\'s affliction could be increased by noise.\\n\\nMarianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with\\nthem. Elinor even advised her against it. But \"no, she would go down;\\nshe could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.\"\\nElinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,\\nthough believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,\\nsaid no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\\nwhile Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into\\nthe dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.\\n\\nWhen there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was\\ncalmer than her sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had\\nshe been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings\\'s well-meant but ill-judged\\nattentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but\\nnot a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts\\npreserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.\\n\\nElinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings\\'s kindness, though its\\neffusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous,\\nmade her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities,\\nwhich her sister could not make or return for herself. Their good\\nfriend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was\\ndue to her which might make her at all less so. She treated her\\ntherefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a\\nfavourite child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have\\nthe best place by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy\\nin the house, and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the\\nday. Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a\\ncheck to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nendeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of\\nsweetmeats and olives, and a good fire. As soon, however, as the\\nconsciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on\\nMarianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of\\nMisery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\\nup and hurried out of the room.\\n\\n\"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, \"how it\\ngrieves me to see her! And I declare if she is not gone away without\\nfinishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to\\ndo her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I\\nwould send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to\\nme, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there\\nis plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord\\nbless you! they care no more about such things!\"\\n\\n\"The lady then,--Miss Grey I think you called her,--is very rich?\"\\n\\n\"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart,\\nstylish girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very\\nwell, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family\\nare all rich together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it\\nwon\\'t come before it\\'s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. No\\nwonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don\\'t\\nsignify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes\\nlove to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to\\nfly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is\\nready to have him. Why don\\'t he, in such a case, sell his horses, let\\nhis house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?\\nI warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till\\nmatters came round. But that won\\'t do nowadays; nothing in the way\\nof pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be\\namiable?\"\\n\\n\"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her\\nmentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day\\nMiss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison\\nwould not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison\\ncould never agree.\"\\n\\n\"And who are the Ellisons?\"\\n\\n\"Her guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for\\nherself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now,\" after pausing a\\nmoment, \"your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan\\nby herself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? Poor dear, it\\nseems quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by and by we shall have a\\nfew friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at?\\nShe hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?\"\\n\\n\"Dear ma\\'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say,\\nwill not leave her room again this evening. I shall persuade her if I\\ncan to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, I believe that will be best for her. Let her name her own\\nsupper, and go to bed. Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and\\nso cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been\\nhanging over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came\\ntoday finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I\\nwould not have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know,\\nhow should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but\\na common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at\\nabout them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when\\nthey hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in\\nConduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see\\nthem to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and\\nSir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest\\nallusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature\\nmust point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\nabout it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to\\nmyself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my\\ndear madam will easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear\\nit talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a\\nword about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time.\\nNo more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very\\nthoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I\\ncertainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such\\nthings, the better, the sooner \\'tis blown over and forgot. And what\\ndoes talking ever do you know?\"\\n\\n\"In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many\\ncases of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances\\nwhich, for the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to\\nbecome the public conversation. I must do _this_ justice to Mr.\\nWilloughby--he has broken no positive engagement with my sister.\"\\n\\n\"Law, my dear! Don\\'t pretend to defend him. No positive engagement\\nindeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the\\nvery rooms they were to live in hereafter!\"\\n\\nElinor, for her sister\\'s sake, could not press the subject farther,\\nand she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby\\'s; since,\\nthough Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the\\nenforcement of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides,\\nMrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, \\'tis a true saying about an ill wind, for it will be\\nall the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye,\\nthat he will. Mind me, now, if they an\\'t married by Mid-summer. Lord!\\nhow he\\'ll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will\\nbe all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year\\nwithout debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I\\nhad forgot her; but she may be \\'prenticed out at a small cost, and\\nthen what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;\\nexactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and\\nconveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered\\nwith the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in\\none corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were\\nthere! Then, there is a dovecote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a\\nvery pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;\\nand, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile\\nfrom the turnpike-road, so \\'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit\\nup in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the\\ncarriages that pass along. Oh! \\'tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in\\nthe village, and the parsonage-house within a stone\\'s throw. To my\\nfancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are\\nforced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour\\nnearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon\\nas I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we\\n_can_ but put Willoughby out of her head!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, if we can do that, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, \"we shall do very well\\nwith or without Colonel Brandon.\" And then rising, she went away to\\njoin Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,\\nleaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,\\ntill Elinor\\'s entrance, had been her only light.\\n\\n\"You had better leave me,\" was all the notice that her sister received\\nfrom her.\\n\\n\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go to bed.\" But this,\\nfrom the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first\\nrefused to do. Her sister\\'s earnest, though gentle persuasion,\\nhowever, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her\\naching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some\\nquiet rest before she left her.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by\\nMrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected that I have\\nsome of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was\\ntasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor\\nhusband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old\\ncolicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the\\nworld. Do take it to your sister.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the\\ncomplaints for which it was recommended, \"how good you are! But I have\\njust left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think\\nnothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me\\nleave, I will drink the wine myself.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes\\nearlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she\\nswallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a\\ncolicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its\\nhealing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\\non herself as on her sister.\\n\\nColonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner\\nof looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied\\nthat he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short,\\nthat he was already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs.\\nJennings was not struck by the same thought; for soon after his\\nentrance, she walked across the room to the tea-table where Elinor\\npresided, and whispered, \"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.\\nHe knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_How fond he was of it!_\"]\\n\\nHe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her\\'s, and, with a look\\nwhich perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after\\nher sister.\\n\\n\"Marianne is not well,\" said she. \"She has been indisposed all day,\\nand we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I heard this morning\\nmay be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at\\nfirst.\"\\n\\n\"What did you hear?\"\\n\\n\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,\\nwhom I _knew_ to be engaged--but how shall I tell you? If you know it\\nalready, as surely you must, I may be spared.\"\\n\\n\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness, \"Mr. Willoughby\\'s\\nmarriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we _do_ know it all. This seems to have\\nbeen a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first\\nunfolded it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"In a stationer\\'s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies\\nwere waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other\\nan account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting\\nconcealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name\\nof Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my\\nattention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing\\nwas now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was\\nno longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,\\nespecially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still\\nmore:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe\\nMagna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!--but it would be\\nimpossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt,\\non inquiry,--for I stayed in the shop till they were gone,--was a Mrs.\\nEllison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss\\nGrey\\'s guardian.\"\\n\\n\"It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand\\npounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.\"\\n\\n\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think--\" He\\nstopped a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust\\nitself, \"And your sister,--how did she,--\"\\n\\n\"Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they\\nmay be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel\\naffliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;\\nand even now, perhaps--but _I_ am almost convinced that he never was\\nreally attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some\\npoints, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed! But your sister does\\nnot--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?\"\\n\\n\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still\\njustify him if she could.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the\\ntea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was\\nnecessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure\\nwhile they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss\\nDashwood\\'s communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of\\nhope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening\\nmore serious and thoughtful than usual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\n\\n\\nFrom a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the\\nnext morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had\\nclosed her eyes.\\n\\nElinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt;\\nand before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject\\nagain and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate\\ncounsel on Elinor\\'s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying\\nopinions on Marianne\\'s, as before. Sometimes she could believe\\nWilloughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at\\nothers, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.\\nAt one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all\\nthe world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and\\nat a third could resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she\\nwas uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was\\npossible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence\\nwhen obliged to endure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief\\nof Mrs. Jennings\\'s entering into her sorrows with any compassion.\\n\\n\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried; \"she cannot feel. Her kindness\\nis not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants\\nis gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\\n\\nElinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her\\nsister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable\\nrefinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her\\non the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a\\npolished manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half\\nthere be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities\\nand an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She\\nexpected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own,\\nand she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their\\nactions on herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters\\nwere together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart\\nof Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her\\nown weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\\nthough Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost\\ngood-will.\\n\\nWith a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,\\nfrom the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room,\\nsaying--\\n\\n\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.\"\\n\\nMarianne heard enough. In one moment her imagination placed before her\\na letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,\\nexplanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and\\ninstantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the\\nroom to enforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the\\nassurances of his letter. The work of one moment was destroyed by the\\nnext. The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was\\nbefore her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed\\nsuch an ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant,\\nshe had never suffered.\\n\\nThe cruelty of Mrs. Jennings, no language, within her reach in her\\nmoments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could\\nreproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\npassionate violence;--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its\\nobject, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still\\nreferring her to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she was\\ncalm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled\\nevery page. Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and\\nrelying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by\\nElinor\\'s application, to entreat from Marianne greater openness\\ntowards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such\\naffection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future\\nhappiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of\\nit.\\n\\nAll her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was\\ndearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her\\nmistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be\\ngone. Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for\\nMarianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own\\nexcept of patience till their mother\\'s wishes could be known; and at\\nlength she obtained her sister\\'s consent to wait for that knowledge.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy\\ntill the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as\\nherself; and positively refusing Elinor\\'s offered attendance, went out\\nalone for the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart,\\naware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by\\nMarianne\\'s letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation\\nfor it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had\\npassed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who\\ncame into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings\\'s going away, remained\\nfixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her\\npen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving\\nstill more fondly over its effect on her mother.\\n\\nIn this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when\\nMarianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was\\nstartled by a rap at the door.\\n\\n\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor. \"So early too! I thought we _had_\\nbeen safe.\"\\n\\nMarianne moved to the window--\\n\\n\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation. \"We are never safe\\nfrom _him._\"\\n\\n\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"\\n\\n\"I will not trust to _that_,\" retreating to her own room. \"A man who\\nhas nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion\\non that of others.\"\\n\\nThe event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on\\ninjustice and error; for Colonel Brandon _did_ come in; and Elinor,\\nwho was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither,\\nand who saw _that_ solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,\\nand in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive\\nher sister for esteeming him so lightly.\\n\\n\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he, after the first\\nsalutation, \"and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more\\neasily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you\\nalone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object--my wish--my sole\\nwish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means of\\ngiving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--but\\nconviction, lasting conviction to your sister\\'s mind. My regard for\\nher, for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, by\\nrelating some circumstances which nothing but a _very_ sincere\\nregard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I am\\njustified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing\\nmyself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be\\nwrong?\" He stopped.\\n\\n\"I understand you,\" said Elinor. \"You have something to tell me of Mr.\\nWilloughby, that will open his character farther. Your telling it will\\nbe the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne. _My_\\ngratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to\\nthat end, and _hers_ must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me\\nhear it.\"\\n\\n\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--but\\nthis will give you no idea--I must go farther back. You will find me a\\nvery awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A\\nshort account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it _shall_\\nbe a short one. On such a subject,\" sighing heavily, \"can I have\\nlittle temptation to be diffuse.\"\\n\\nHe stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went\\non.\\n\\n\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to be\\nsupposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation\\nbetween us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a\\ndance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling,\\nin some measure, your sister Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have _not_ forgotten it.\" He looked\\npleased by this remembrance, and added--\\n\\n\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender\\nrecollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well\\nin mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of\\nfancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an\\norphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our\\nages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were\\nplayfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not\\nlove Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as\\nperhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you\\nmight think me incapable of having ever felt. Her\\'s, for me, was, I\\nbelieve, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\\nand it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At\\nseventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married--married\\nagainst her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our\\nfamily estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be\\nsaid for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.\\nMy brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped\\nthat her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for\\nsome time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she\\nexperienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\\nshe had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate! I have\\nnever told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of\\neloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my\\ncousin\\'s maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation\\nfar distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\\ntill my father\\'s point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too\\nfar, and the blow was a severe one, but had her marriage been happy,\\nso young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it,\\nor at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not\\nthe case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not\\nwhat they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her\\nunkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so\\ninexperienced as Mrs. Brandon\\'s, was but too natural. She resigned\\nherself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it\\nbeen if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the\\nremembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a\\nhusband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or\\nrestrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their\\nmarriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should\\nfall? Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the\\nhappiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose\\nhad procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\\nhe continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of trifling\\nweight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years\\nafterwards, of her divorce. It was _that_ which threw this\\ngloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered--\"\\n\\nHe could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes\\nabout the room. Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by\\nhis distress, could not speak. He saw her concern, and coming to her,\\ntook her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few\\nminutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\\n\\n\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned\\nto England. My first care, when I _did_ arrive, was of course to seek\\nfor her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could\\nnot trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to\\nfear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of\\nsin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor\\nsufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my\\nbrother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months\\nbefore to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,\\nthat her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to\\ndispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I\\nhad been six months in England, I _did_ find her. Regard for a former\\nservant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me\\nto visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and\\nthere, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my\\nunfortunate sister. So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering\\nof every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure\\nbefore me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\\non whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her--but I\\nhave no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I\\nhave pained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in\\nthe last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was\\nmy greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time\\nfor a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her\\nplaced in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited\\nher every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her\\nlast moments.\"\\n\\nAgain he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in\\nan exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate\\nfriend.\\n\\n\"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\" said he, \"by the\\nresemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.\\nTheir fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural\\nsweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a\\nhappier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see\\nthe other be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been\\ndistressing you for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as\\nthis--untouched for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at\\nall! I _will_ be more collected--more concise. She left to my care her\\nonly child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty\\nconnection, who was then about three years old. She loved the child,\\nand had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to\\nme; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by\\nwatching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations\\nallowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was\\ntherefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and\\nafter the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago,\\nand which left to me the possession of the family property,) she\\nvisited me at Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I am\\nwell aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer\\nconnection with her. It is now three years ago (she had just reached\\nher fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her\\nunder the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,\\nwho had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time\\nof life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her\\nsituation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly\\ndisappeared. I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\\nout,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young\\nfriends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him\\nto be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his\\ndaughter--better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and\\nill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though\\nshe certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a\\nquick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for\\nhe had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were\\nranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he\\ntried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of\\nhis daughter\\'s being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I\\ncould learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight\\nlong months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I feared,\\nmay be imagined; and what I suffered too.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"could it be--could Willoughby!\"--\\n\\n\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued, \"came in a\\nletter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from\\nDelaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party\\nto Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\\nwhich I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,\\nand which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby\\nimagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in\\nbreaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one\\nwhom he had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he known it, what would\\nit have availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the\\nsmiles of your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who\\n_can_ feel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and\\ninnocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with\\nno creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He\\nhad left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor\\nrelieved her.\"\\n\\n\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.\\n\\n\"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse\\nthan both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess\\nwhat I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever,\\nand on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have\\nfelt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you\\nalone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to\\ndo when it _was_ known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you\\nthen; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so\\ndeceived; to see your sister--but what could I do? I had no hope of\\ninterfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister\\'s\\ninfluence might yet reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable\\nusage, who can tell what were his designs on her. Whatever they may\\nhave been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless _will_, turn\\nwith gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with\\nthat of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless\\nsituation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an\\naffection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a\\nmind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\\nSurely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her\\nown sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can\\nbring no disgrace. On the contrary, every friend must be made still\\nmore her friend by them. Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for\\nher fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. Use your own\\ndiscretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. You\\nmust know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and\\nfrom my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her\\nregrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this\\naccount of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to\\nhave been intended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;\\nattended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage\\nto Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.\\n\\n\"I have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her endeavors to acquit him\\nthan by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most\\nperfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first\\nshe will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have\\nyou,\" she continued, after a short silence, \"ever seen Mr. Willoughby\\nsince you left him at Barton?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once I have. One meeting was unavoidable.\"\\n\\nElinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying--\\n\\n\"What? have you met him to--\"\\n\\n\"I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most\\nreluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town,\\nwhich was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he\\nto defend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the\\nmeeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"\\n\\nElinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a\\nsoldier she presumed not to censure it.\\n\\n\"Such,\" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, \"has been the unhappy\\nresemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so\\nimperfectly have I discharged my trust!\"\\n\\n\"Is she still in town?\"\\n\\n\"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near\\nher delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there\\nshe remains.\"\\n\\nRecollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor\\nfrom her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again\\nthe same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion\\nand esteem for him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\n\\n\\nWhen the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss\\nDashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was\\nnot entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne\\nappeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to\\nit all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\\nobjection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and\\nseemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But\\nthough this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt\\n_was_ carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the\\neffect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he\\ncalled, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind\\nof compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less\\nviolently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.\\nHer mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\\nShe felt the loss of Willoughby\\'s character yet more heavily than she\\nhad felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss\\nWilliams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his\\ndesigns might _once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much\\non her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she\\nfelt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave\\nmore pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most\\nopen and most frequent confession of them.\\n\\nTo give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and\\nanswering Elinor\\'s letter would be only to give a repetition of what\\nher daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly\\nless painful than Marianne\\'s, and an indignation even greater than\\nElinor\\'s. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\\narrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her\\nanxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with\\nfortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of\\nMarianne\\'s affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!\\nmortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which\\n_she_ could wish her not to indulge!\\n\\nAgainst the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had\\ndetermined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at\\nthat time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be\\nbringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by\\nconstantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen\\nhim there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all\\nmeans not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of\\nwhich, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to\\ncomprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of\\nobjects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would\\nbe inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at\\ntimes, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some\\namusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.\\n\\nFrom all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her\\nto be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his\\nacquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her\\nfriends. Design could never bring them in each other\\'s way: negligence\\ncould never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in\\nits favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of\\nBarton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at\\nAllenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at\\nfirst as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain\\none.\\n\\nShe had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where\\nthey were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his\\nwife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged\\nit right that they should sometimes see their brother.\\n\\nMarianne had promised to be guided by her mother\\'s opinion, and she\\nsubmitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved\\nperfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt\\nit to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by\\nrequiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her\\nmother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent\\nher ever knowing a moment\\'s rest.\\n\\nBut it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought\\nevil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the\\nother hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid\\nEdward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their\\nlonger stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it\\nwould be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.\\n\\nHer carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby\\'s\\nname mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing\\nit herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor\\nSir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\\nElinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards\\nherself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day\\nafter day to the indignation of them all.\\n\\nSir John, could not have thought it possible. \"A man of whom he had\\nalways had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He\\ndid not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an\\nunaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart.\\nHe would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for\\nall the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,\\nand they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel\\nof a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met\\nthat he had offered him one of Folly\\'s puppies! and this was the end\\nof it!\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. \"She was determined to\\ndrop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she\\nhad never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her\\nheart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,\\nfor it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much\\nthat she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should\\ntell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.\"\\n\\nThe rest of Mrs. Palmer\\'s sympathy was shown in procuring all the\\nparticulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and\\ncommunicating them to Elinor. She could soon tell at what coachmaker\\'s\\nthe new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby\\'s\\nportrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey\\'s clothes might be\\nseen.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Offered him one of Folly\\'s puppies._]\\n\\nThe calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a\\nhappy relief to Elinor\\'s spirits, oppressed as they often were by\\nthe clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to\\nbe sure of exciting no interest in _one_ person at least among their\\ncircle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was _one_ who\\nwould meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any\\nanxiety for her sister\\'s health.\\n\\nEvery qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the\\nmoment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried\\ndown by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more\\nindispensable to comfort than good-nature.\\n\\nLady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,\\nor twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, \"It is very\\nshocking, indeed!\" and by the means of this continual though gentle\\nvent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first\\nwithout the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without\\nrecollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the\\ndignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was\\nwrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the\\ninterest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though\\nrather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would\\nat once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her\\nas soon as she married.\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome\\nto Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate\\ndiscussion of her sister\\'s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with\\nconfidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing\\npast sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye\\nwith which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her\\nvoice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or\\ncould oblige herself to speak to him. _These_ assured him that his\\nexertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and\\n_these_ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;\\nbut Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that\\nthe Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither\\nprevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make\\nit for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of\\nMid-summer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end\\nof a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding\\nbetween the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that\\nthe honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would\\nall be made over to _her_; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased\\nto think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\nEarly in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby\\'s\\nletter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he\\nwas married. She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to\\nherself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she\\nwas desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it\\nfrom the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every\\nmorning.\\n\\nShe received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on\\nit, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would\\nburst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less\\npitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.\\n\\nThe Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now\\nhoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to\\nprevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow\\nfirst fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.\\n\\nAbout this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin\\'s\\nhouse in Bartlett\\'s Buildings, Holborn, presented themselves again\\nbefore their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and\\nwere welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\\n\\nElinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her\\npain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the\\noverpowering delight of Lucy in finding her _still_ in town.\\n\\n\"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here\\n_still_,\" said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.\\n\"But I always thought I _should_ I was almost sure you would not leave\\nLondon yet awhile; though you _told_ me, you know, at Barton, that you\\nshould not stay above a _month._ But I thought, at the time, that you\\nwould most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would\\nhave been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and\\nsister came. And now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone.\\nI am amazingly glad you did not keep to _your word._\"\\n\\nElinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her\\nself-command to make it appear that she did _not._\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did you travel?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the stage, I assure you,\" replied Miss Steele, with quick\\nexultation; \"we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to\\nattend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we\\'d join\\nhim in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or\\ntwelve shillings more than we did.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is\\na single man, I warrant you.\"\\n\\n\"There now,\" said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, \"everybody laughs\\nat me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they\\nare sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never\\nthink about him from one hour\\'s end to another. \\'Lord! here comes your\\nbeau, Nancy,\\' my cousin said t\\'other day, when she saw him crossing\\nthe street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who\\nyou mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won\\'t do--the Doctor is\\nthe man, I see.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed!\" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, \"and I\\nbeg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she\\ncertainly would _not_, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.\\n\\n\"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss\\nDashwood, when they come to town,\" said Lucy, returning, after a\\ncessation of hostile hints, to the charge.\\n\\n\"No, I do not think we shall.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I dare say you will.\"\\n\\nElinor would not humour her by farther opposition.\\n\\n\"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for\\nso long a time together!\"\\n\\n\"Long a time, indeed!\" interposed Mrs. Jennings. \"Why, their visit is\\nbut just begun!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _A very smart beau._]\\n\\nLucy was silenced.\\n\\n\"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,\" said Miss\\nSteele. \"I am sorry she is not well--\" for Marianne had left the room\\non their arrival.\\n\\n\"You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the\\npleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with\\nnervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and\\nme!--I think she might see _us_; and I am sure we would not speak a\\nword.\"\\n\\nElinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was\\nperhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore\\nnot able to come to them.\\n\\n\"Oh, if that\\'s all,\" cried Miss Steele, \"we can just as well go and\\nsee _her._\"\\n\\nElinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but\\nshe was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy\\'s sharp reprimand,\\nwhich now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness\\nto the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\n\\n\\nAfter some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister\\'s entreaties,\\nand consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for\\nhalf an hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no\\nvisits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray\\'s in\\nSackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the\\nexchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\\n\\nWhen they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there\\nwas a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call;\\nand as she had no business at Gray\\'s, it was resolved, that while her\\nyoung friends transacted their\\'s, she should pay her visit and return\\nfor them.\\n\\nOn ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people\\nbefore them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to\\ntend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be\\ndone was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to\\npromise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing\\nthere, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting\\nhis politeness to a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye,\\nand the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He\\nwas giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size,\\nshape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining\\nand debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the\\nshop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no\\nleisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was\\ncomprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which\\nserved to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of\\nstrong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first\\nstyle of fashion.\\n\\nMarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and\\nresentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on\\nthe puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of\\nthe different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by\\nremaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect\\nher thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing\\naround her, in Mr. Gray\\'s shop, as in her own bedroom.\\n\\nAt last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,\\nall received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the\\nlast day on which his existence could be continued without the\\npossession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely\\ncare, and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a\\none as seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off\\nwith a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.\\n\\nElinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point\\nof concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her\\nside. She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some\\nsurprise to be her brother.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Introduced to Mrs. Jennings._]\\n\\nTheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very\\ncreditable appearance in Mr. Gray\\'s shop. John Dashwood was really far\\nfrom being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them\\nsatisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and\\nattentive.\\n\\nElinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.\\n\\n\"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,\" said he, \"but it was\\nimpossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts\\nat Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs.\\nFerrars. Harry was vastly pleased. _This_ morning I had fully intended\\nto call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one\\nhas always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to\\nbespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able\\nto call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs.\\nJennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the\\nMiddletons too, you must introduce me to _them_. As my mother-in-law\\'s\\nrelations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. They are\\nexcellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness\\nin every particular, is more than I can express.\"\\n\\n\"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.\\nBut so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are\\nrelated to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to\\nmake your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you\\nare most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for\\nnothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the\\nmost complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all\\nseemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us\\nto hear it, I assure you.\"\\n\\nElinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to\\nbe spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.\\nJennings\\'s servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for\\nthem at the door.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs.\\nJennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being\\nable to call on them the next day, took leave.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Mrs. Jennings assured him directly that she should not\\nstand upon ceremony._]\\n\\nHis visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from\\ntheir sister-in-law, for not coming too; \"but she was so much engaged\\nwith her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.\"\\nMrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not\\nstand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like\\nit, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and\\nbring her sisters to see her. His manners to _them_, though calm, were\\nperfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on\\nColonel Brandon\\'s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a\\ncuriosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be\\nrich, to be equally civil to _him._\\n\\nAfter staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him\\nto Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.\\nThe weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented. As soon as\\nthey were out of the house, his enquiries began.\\n\\n\"Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,\\nElinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable\\nestablishment in life.\"\\n\\n\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"He likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What\\nis the amount of his fortune?\"\\n\\n\"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\\n\\n\"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself up to a pitch of\\nenthusiastic generosity, he added, \"Elinor, I wish with all my heart\\nit were _twice_ as much, for your sake.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am very sure that\\nColonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me._\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little\\ntrouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be\\nundecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his\\nfriends may all advise him against it. But some of those little\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix\\nhim, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should\\nnot try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on\\nyour side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is\\nquite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have\\ntoo much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man;\\nand no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with\\nyou and your family. It is a match that must give universal\\nsatisfaction. In short, it is a kind of thing that,\" lowering his\\nvoice to an important whisper, \"will be exceedingly welcome to _all\\nparties._\" Recollecting himself, however, he added, \"That is, I mean\\nto say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled;\\nFanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I\\nassure you. And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured\\nwoman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\\nthe other day.\"\\n\\nElinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\\n\\n\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued, \"something\\ndroll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the\\nsame time. And yet it is not very unlikely.\"\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution, \"going to be\\nmarried?\"\\n\\n\"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.\\nHe has a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost\\nliberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if\\nthe match takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\\nof the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable\\nconnection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place\\nin time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away,\\nto make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give\\nyou another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we\\ncame to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just\\nnow, she put bank-notes into Fanny\\'s hands to the amount of two\\nhundred pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a\\ngreat expense while we are here.\"\\n\\nHe paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to\\nsay--\\n\\n\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be\\nconsiderable; but your income is a large one.\"\\n\\n\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to\\ncomplain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope\\nwill in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying\\non, is a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase\\nwithin this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place,\\nwhere old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me\\nin every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I\\nfelt it my duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my\\nconscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his\\nconvenience; and it _has_ cost me a vast deal of money.\"\\n\\n\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for\\nmore than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have\\nbeen very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,\\nthat if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker\\'s\\nhands, I must have sold out to very great loss.\"\\n\\nElinor could only smile.\\n\\n\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming\\nto Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the\\nStanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they\\nwere) to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he\\nhad an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose,\\nbut, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large\\npurchases of linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken\\naway. You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be\\nfrom being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars\\'s kindness is.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality, I hope you\\nmay yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\" he gravely replied; \"but\\nhowever there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone\\nlaid of Fanny\\'s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the\\nflower-garden marked out.\"\\n\\n\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\\n\\n\"Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come\\ndown to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many\\nparts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before\\nit, and be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns\\nthat grew in patches over the brow.\"\\n\\nElinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very\\nthankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.\\n\\nHaving now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the\\nnecessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in\\nhis next visit at Gray\\'s, his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he\\nbegan to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\n\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style of\\nliving, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an\\nacquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but\\nin the end may prove materially advantageous. Her inviting you to town\\nis certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks\\naltogether so great a regard for you, that in all probability when she\\ndies you will not be forgotten. She must have a great deal to leave.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her\\njointure, which will descend to her children.\"\\n\\n\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few\\npeople of common prudence will do _that_; and whatever she saves, she\\nwill be able to dispose of.\"\\n\\n\"And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her\\ndaughters, than to us?\"\\n\\n\"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I\\ncannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.\\nWhereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and\\ntreating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on\\nher future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not\\ndisregard. Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can\\nhardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.\"\\n\\n\"But she raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your\\nanxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself, \"people have\\nlittle, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is\\nthe matter with Marianne?--she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,\\nand is grown quite thin. Is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several\\nweeks.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness\\ndestroys the bloom for ever! Her\\'s has been a very short one! She was\\nas handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to\\nattract the man. There was something in her style of beauty, to\\nplease them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would\\nmarry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly\\nfond of _you_, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken,\\nhowever. I question whether Marianne _now_, will marry a man worth\\nmore than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very\\nmuch deceived if _you_ do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very\\nlittle of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly\\nglad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having\\nFanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your\\nvisitors.\"\\n\\nElinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no\\nlikelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation\\nof too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really\\nresolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the\\nmarriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enough\\nfor having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly\\nanxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from\\nColonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\\nof atoning for his own neglect.\\n\\nThey were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John\\ncame in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on\\nall sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood\\ndid not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very\\ngood-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his\\nappearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood\\nwent away delighted with both.\\n\\n\"I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,\" said he, as he\\nwalked back with his sister. \"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant\\nwoman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs.\\nJennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant\\nas her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of\\nvisiting _her_, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case,\\nand very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow\\nof a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs.\\nFerrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her\\ndaughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate\\nwith. But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband\\'s judgment,\\nthat she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her\\ndaughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means\\nunworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of\\nthe most charming women in the world!\\n\\nLady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a\\nkind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually\\nattracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid\\npropriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.\\n\\nThe same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the\\ngood opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs.\\nJennings, and to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little\\nproud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband\\'s\\nsisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to\\nsay to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley\\nStreet, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\\n\\nElinor wanted very much to know, though she did not choose to ask,\\nwhether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny\\nvoluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that\\nhis marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband\\'s\\nexpectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed\\nthem still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be\\ntoo sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The\\nintelligence however, which _she_ would not give, soon flowed from\\nanother quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor\\'s compassion\\non being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.\\nand Mrs. Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett\\'s Buildings for fear\\nof detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to\\nbe told, they could do nothing at present but write.\\n\\nEdward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short\\ntime, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on\\nthe table, when they returned from their morning\\'s engagements. Elinor\\nwas pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had\\nmissed him.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons,\\nthat, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined\\nto give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\\ninvited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very\\ngood house for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were\\ninvited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel\\nBrandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were,\\nreceived his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more\\npleasure. They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\\nwhether her sons were to be of the party. The expectation of seeing\\n_her_, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement;\\nfor though she could now meet Edward\\'s mother without that strong\\nanxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though\\nshe could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of\\nherself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her\\ncuriosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\\n\\nThe interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon\\nafterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing\\nthat the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.\\n\\nSo well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so\\nagreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was\\ncertainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as\\nready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit\\nStreet; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\\nSteeles, as soon as the Dashwoods\\' invitation was known, that their\\nvisit should begin a few days before the party took place.\\n\\nTheir claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of\\nthe gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother,\\nmight not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her\\ntable; but as Lady Middleton\\'s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\\nwho had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a\\nnearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have\\nan opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier\\nin her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood\\'s card.\\n\\nOn Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to\\ndetermine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his\\nmother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the\\nfirst time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\\nknew how she could bear it!\\n\\nThese apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and\\ncertainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her\\nown recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself\\nto be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward\\ncertainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to\\nbe carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept\\naway by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal\\nwhen they were together.\\n\\nThe important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies\\nto this formidable mother-in-law.\\n\\n\"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs\\ntogether--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,\\nthat they all followed the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody\\nhere but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good\\ngracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness\\ndepends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\\n\\nElinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the\\npossibility of its being Miss Morton\\'s mother, rather than her own,\\nwhom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured\\nher, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\\namazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at\\nleast to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in\\nher figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her\\ncomplexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and\\nnaturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had\\nrescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it\\nthe strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of\\nmany words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to\\nthe number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\\nnot one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the\\nspirited determination of disliking her at all events.\\n\\nElinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months\\nago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs.\\nFerrars\\' power to distress her by it now; and the difference of her\\nmanners to the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made\\nto humble her more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see\\nthe graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very\\nperson--for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\\nhad they known as much as she did, they would have been most anxious\\nto mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound\\nthem, sat pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a\\ngraciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited\\nfolly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with\\nwhich the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly\\ndespising them all four.\\n\\nLucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss\\nSteele wanted only to be teased about Dr. Davies to be perfectly\\nhappy.\\n\\nThe dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every\\nthing bespoke the Mistress\\'s inclination for show, and the Master\\'s\\nability to support it. In spite of the improvements and additions\\nwhich were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\\nhaving once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell\\nout at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had\\ntried to infer from it; no poverty of any kind, except of\\nconversation, appeared; but there, the deficiency was considerable.\\nJohn Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\\nand his wife had still less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in\\nthis; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors,\\nwho almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications\\nfor being agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want\\nof elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\\n\\nWhen the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this\\npoverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the\\ndiscourse with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\\nand breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only\\nengaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative\\nheights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton\\'s second son William,\\nwho were nearly of the same age.\\n\\nHad both the children been there, the affair might have been\\ndetermined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was\\npresent, it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every\\nbody had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to\\nrepeat it over and over again as often as they liked.\\n\\nThe parties stood thus:--\\n\\nThe two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the\\ntallest, politely decided in favour of the other. The two\\ngrandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were\\nequally earnest in support of their own descendant.\\n\\nLucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,\\nthought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could\\nnot conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world\\nbetween them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as\\nfast as she could, in favour of each.\\n\\nElinor, having once delivered her opinion on William\\'s side, by which\\nshe offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the\\nnecessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when\\ncalled on for her\\'s, offended them all, by declaring that she had no\\nopinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\\n\\nBefore her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty\\npair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted\\nand brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these\\nscreens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other\\ngentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel\\nBrandon for his admiration.\\n\\n\"These are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you, as a man of\\ntaste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether\\nyou have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she\\nis in general reckoned to draw extremely well.\"\\n\\nThe Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,\\nwarmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by\\nMiss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course\\nexcited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,\\nnot aware of their being Elinor\\'s work, particularly requested to look\\nat them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady\\nMiddleton\\'s approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,\\nconsiderately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by\\nMiss Dashwood.\\n\\n\"Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without regarding them\\nat all, returned them to her daughter.\\n\\nPerhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude\\nenough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said--\\n\\n\"They are very pretty, ma\\'am--an\\'t they?\" But then again, the dread of\\nhaving been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over\\nher, for she presently added, \"Do you not think they are something in\\nMiss Morton\\'s style of painting, Ma\\'am?--She _does_ paint most\\ndelightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!\"\\n\\n\"Beautifully indeed! But _she_ does every thing well.\"\\n\\nMarianne could not bear this. She was already greatly displeased with\\nMrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor\\'s\\nexpense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant\\nby it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth--\\n\\n\"This is admiration of a very particular kind! what is Miss Morton to\\nus? who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom _we_ think\\nand speak.\"\\n\\nAnd so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law\\'s hands,\\nto admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Mrs. Ferrars._]\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more\\nstiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, \"Miss\\nMorton is Lord Morton\\'s daughter.\"\\n\\nFanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at\\nhis sister\\'s audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne\\'s warmth\\nthan she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon\\'s eyes, as\\nthey were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was\\namiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a\\nsister slighted in the smallest point.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.\\nFerrars\\'s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell\\nsuch difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart\\ntaught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\\naffectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister\\'s\\nchair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to\\nhers, said in a low, but eager, voice--\\n\\n\"Dear, dear Elinor, don\\'t mind them. Don\\'t let them make _you_\\nunhappy.\"\\n\\nShe could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her\\nface on Elinor\\'s shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body\\'s\\nattention was called, and almost every body was concerned. Colonel\\nBrandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did. Mrs.\\nJennings, with a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\\nher her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the\\nauthor of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to\\none close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account\\nof the whole shocking affair.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end\\nto the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits\\nretained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.\\n\\n\"Poor Marianne!\" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,\\nas soon as he could secure his attention: \"She has not such good\\nhealth as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor\\'s\\nconstitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying\\nto a young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her personal\\nattractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne _was_\\nremarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now\\nyou see it is all gone.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\n\\n\\nElinor\\'s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found in\\nher every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between\\nthe families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her\\nmeanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend\\nall the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and\\nretarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise\\nfree;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_\\nsake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any\\nother of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s creation, preserved her from all dependence\\nupon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least,\\nif she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward\\'s being\\nfettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she\\n_ought_ to have rejoiced.\\n\\nShe wondered that Lucy\\'s spirits could be so very much elevated by the\\ncivility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so\\nvery much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid\\nher because she was _not Elinor_ appear a compliment to herself--or to\\nallow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\\nbecause her real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not\\nonly been declared by Lucy\\'s eyes at the time, but was declared over\\nagain the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady\\nMiddleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing\\nElinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.\\n\\nThe chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon\\nafter she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\\n\\n\"My dear friend,\" cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, \"I\\ncome to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering\\nas Mrs. Ferrars\\'s way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable\\nas she was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the\\nvery moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her\\nbehaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to\\nme. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck\\nwith it?\"\\n\\n\"She was certainly very civil to you.\"\\n\\n\"Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?--I saw a vast deal\\nmore. Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,\\nno hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and\\naffability!\"\\n\\nElinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to\\nown that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to\\ngo on.\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,\" said she, \"nothing\\ncould be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was\\nnot the case--\"\\n\\n\"I guessed you would say so,\" replied Lucy quickly--\"but there was no\\nreason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she\\ndid not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan\\'t talk me out of\\nmy satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no\\ndifficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a\\ncharming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women,\\nindeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.\\nDashwood was!\"\\n\\nTo this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.\\n\\n\"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don\\'t speak;--sure you\\nan\\'t well.\"\\n\\n\"I never was in better health.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I\\nshould be sorry to have _you_ ill; you, that have been the greatest\\ncomfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done\\nwithout your friendship.\"--\\n\\nElinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.\\nBut it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied--\\n\\n\"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to\\nEdward\\'s love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward!--But\\nnow there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty\\noften, for Lady Middleton\\'s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall\\nbe a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half\\nhis time with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars\\nwill visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good\\nto say more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are\\nsuch charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I\\nthink of her, you cannot speak too high.\"\\n\\nBut Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she\\n_should_ tell her sister. Lucy continued.\\n\\n\"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took\\na dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for\\ninstance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice\\nof me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I\\nmean--if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should\\nhave gave it all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where\\nshe _does_ dislike, I know it is most violent.\"\\n\\nElinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by\\nthe door\\'s being thrown open, the servant\\'s announcing Mr. Ferrars,\\nand Edward\\'s immediately walking in.\\n\\nIt was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that\\nit was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to\\nhave as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to\\nadvance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest\\nform, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had\\nfallen on them. They were not only all three together, but were\\ntogether without the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered\\nthemselves first. It was not Lucy\\'s business to put herself forward,\\nand the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She could\\ntherefore only _look_ her tenderness, and after slightly addressing\\nhim, said no more.\\n\\nBut Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and\\nher own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment\\'s\\nrecollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost\\neasy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\\nimproved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the\\nconsciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from\\nsaying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much\\nregretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.\\nShe would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as\\na friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes\\nof Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.\\n\\nHer manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage\\nenough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the\\nladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his\\nsex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of\\nLucy\\'s, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor\\'s.\\n\\nLucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no\\ncontribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;\\nand almost every thing that _was_ said, proceeded from Elinor, who was\\nobliged to volunteer all the information about her mother\\'s health,\\ntheir coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\\nbut never did.\\n\\nHer exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself\\nso heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching\\nMarianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,\\nand _that_ in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several\\nminutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude,\\nbefore she went to her sister. When that was once done, however, it\\nwas time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne\\'s joy\\nhurried her into the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing\\nhim was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and\\nstrongly spoken. She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a\\nvoice that expressed the affection of a sister.\\n\\n\"Dear Edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great happiness!--This\\nwould almost make amends for every thing!\"\\n\\nEdward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such\\nwitnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all\\nsat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was\\nlooking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and\\nsometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other\\nshould be checked by Lucy\\'s unwelcome presence. Edward was the first\\nto speak, and it was to notice Marianne\\'s altered looks, and express\\nhis fear of her not finding London agree with her.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t think of me!\" she replied with spirited earnestness, though\\nher eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, \"don\\'t think of _my_\\nhealth. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.\"\\n\\nThis remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor\\nto conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no\\nvery benignant expression.\\n\\n\"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might\\nintroduce another subject.\\n\\n\"Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.\\nThe sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and\\nthank Heaven! you are what you always were!\"\\n\\nShe paused--no one spoke.\\n\\n\"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must employ Edward to take\\ncare of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we\\nshall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to\\naccept the charge.\"\\n\\nPoor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even\\nhimself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace\\nit to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\\nand soon talked of something else.\\n\\n\"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so\\nwretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which\\ncannot be said now.\"\\n\\nAnd with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her\\nfinding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her\\nbeing particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in\\nprivate.\\n\\n\"But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?\"\\n\\n\"I was engaged elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be met?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\" cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on\\nher, \"you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have\\nno mind to keep them, little as well as great.\"\\n\\nElinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the\\nsting; for she calmly replied--\\n\\n\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that\\nconscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe\\nhe _has_ the most delicate conscience in the world; the most\\nscrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however\\nit may make against his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful\\nof giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of\\nbeing selfish, of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will\\nsay it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must\\nbe no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem,\\nmust submit to my open commendation.\"\\n\\nThe nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened\\nto be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her\\nauditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon\\ngot up to go away.\\n\\n\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward, this must not be.\"\\n\\nAnd drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy\\ncould not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he\\nwould go; and Lucy, who would have outstayed him, had his visit lasted\\ntwo hours, soon afterwards went away.\\n\\n\"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne, on her leaving\\nthem. \"Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teasing to\\nEdward!\"\\n\\n\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known\\nto him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as\\nwell as ourselves.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know, Elinor, that\\nthis is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to\\nhave your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case,\\nyou ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do\\nit. I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not\\nreally wanted.\"\\n\\nShe then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,\\nfor bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give\\nno information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the\\nconsequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was\\nobliged to submit to it. All that she could hope, was that Edward\\nwould not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing\\nMarianne\\'s mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of\\nthe pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had\\nevery reason to expect.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Drawing him a little aside._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\n\\n\\nWithin a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the\\nworld, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a\\nson and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least\\nto all those intimate connections who knew it before.\\n\\nThis event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings\\'s happiness, produced a\\ntemporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a\\nlike degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished\\nto be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every\\nmorning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in\\nthe evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the\\nMiddletons, spent the whole of every day, in Conduit Street. For their\\nown comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the\\nmorning, in Mrs. Jennings\\'s house; but it was not a thing to be urged\\nagainst the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over\\nto Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in\\nfact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\\n\\nThey had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and\\nby the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on\\n_their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to\\nmonopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton\\'s\\nbehaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\\nBecause they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not\\nbelieve them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she\\nfancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to\\nbe satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common\\nuse, and easily given.\\n\\nTheir presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the\\nidleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was\\nashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was\\nproud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would\\ndespise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\\nthree, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her\\nto it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and\\nminute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr.\\nWilloughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the\\nsacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\\narrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though\\nshe often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and\\nmore than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before\\nMarianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the\\nformer, or of disgust in the latter. An effort even yet lighter might\\nhave made her their friend. Would they only have laughed at her about\\nthe Doctor! But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined\\nto oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a\\nwhole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what\\nshe was kind enough to bestow on herself.\\n\\nAll these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally\\nunsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing\\nfor the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young\\nfriends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old\\nwoman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John\\'s, sometimes at\\nher own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent\\nspirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte\\'s well\\ndoing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail\\nof her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\\nOne thing _did_ disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.\\nMr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his\\nsex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly\\nperceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between\\nthis baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no\\nconvincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was\\nnot exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even\\nbe brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the\\nfinest child in the world.\\n\\nI come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time\\nbefell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters\\nwith Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another\\nof her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not\\napparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations\\nof other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our\\nconduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one\\'s happiness\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present\\ninstance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun\\ntruth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss\\nDashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood\\'s sisters, she\\nimmediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\\nmisconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\\ninvitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a\\nsmall musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that\\nMrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly\\ngreat inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods,\\nbut, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness\\nof appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that\\nthey might not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of\\ndisappointing them, it was true, must always be her\\'s. But that was\\nnot enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which\\nthey know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any\\nthing better from them.\\n\\nMarianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of\\ngoing out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to\\nher, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and\\nmechanically for every evening\\'s engagement, though without expecting\\nthe smallest amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till\\nthe last moment, where it was to take her.\\n\\nTo her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as\\nnot to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her\\ntoilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes\\nof their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her_\\nminute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and\\nasked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every\\npart of Marianne\\'s dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns\\naltogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not\\nwithout hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing\\ncost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\\nThe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally\\nconcluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was\\nconsidered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after\\nundergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the\\ncolour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost\\nsure of being told that upon \"her word she looked vastly smart, and\\nshe dared to say she would make a great many conquests.\"\\n\\nWith such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present\\noccasion, to her brother\\'s carriage; which they were ready to enter\\nfive minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very\\nagreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\\nof her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part\\nthat might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.\\n\\nThe events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like\\nother musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real\\ntaste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;\\nand the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\\nand that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in\\nEngland.\\n\\nAs Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no\\nscruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it\\nsuited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and\\nvioloncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the\\nroom. In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of\\nyoung men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on\\ntoothpick-cases at Gray\\'s. She perceived him soon afterwards looking\\nat herself, and speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just\\ndetermined to find out his name from the latter, when they both came\\ntowards her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert\\nFerrars.\\n\\nHe addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow\\nwhich assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was\\nexactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy\\nhad it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his\\nown merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his\\nbrother\\'s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the\\nill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun. But while she\\nwondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that\\nthe emptiness and conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with\\nthe modesty and worth of the other. Why they _were_ different, Robert\\nexplained to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour\\'s\\nconversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\\n_gaucherie_ which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper\\nsociety, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any\\nnatural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;\\nwhile he himself, though probably without any particular, any material\\nsuperiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\\n\\n\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more; and so I\\noften tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. \\'My dear Madam,\\'\\nI always say to her, \\'you must make yourself easy. The evil is now\\nirremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you\\nbe persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to\\nplace Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his\\nlife? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,\\ninstead of sending him to Mr. Pratt\\'s, all this would have been\\nprevented.\\' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and\\nmy mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\\n\\nElinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her\\ngeneral estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not\\nthink of Edward\\'s abode in Mr. Pratt\\'s family, with any satisfaction.\\n\\n\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his next observation, \"in a\\ncottage near Dawlish.\"\\n\\nElinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather\\nsurprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without\\nliving near Dawlish. He bestowed his hearty approbation however on\\ntheir species of house.\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond of a cottage; there\\nis always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest,\\nif I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one\\nmyself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself\\ndown at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I\\nadvise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend\\nLord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\\nand laid before me three different plans of Bonomi\\'s. I was to decide\\non the best of them. \\'My dear Courtland,\\' said I, immediately throwing\\nthem all into the fire, \\'do not adopt either of them, but by all means\\nbuild a cottage.\\' And that I fancy, will be the end of it.\\n\\n\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in\\na cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend\\nElliott\\'s, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. \\'But\\nhow can it be done?\\' said she; \\'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is\\nto be managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten\\ncouple, and where can the supper be?\\' I immediately saw that there\\ncould be no difficulty in it, so I said, \\'My dear Lady Elliott, do not\\nbe uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\\ncard-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open\\nfor tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the\\nsaloon.\\' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the\\ndining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the\\naffair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you\\nsee, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be\\nas well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.\"\\n\\nElinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the\\ncompliment of rational opposition.\\n\\nAs John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,\\nhis mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a\\nthought struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his\\nwife, for her approbation, when they got home. The consideration of\\nMrs. Dennison\\'s mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had\\nsuggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,\\nwhile Mrs. Jennings\\'s engagements kept her from home. The expense\\nwould be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an\\nattention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be\\nrequisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his\\nfather. Fanny was startled at the proposal.\\n\\n\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she, \"without affronting Lady\\nMiddleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be\\nexceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any\\nattention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But\\nthey are Lady Middleton\\'s visitors. How can I ask them away from her?\"\\n\\nHer husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her\\nobjection. \"They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit\\nStreet, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the\\nsame number of days to such near relations.\"\\n\\nFanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said--\\n\\n\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.\\nBut I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend\\na few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls;\\nand I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\\nwell by Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but\\nthe Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like\\nthem; indeed, you _do_ like them, you know, very much already, and so\\ndoes my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!\"\\n\\nMr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss\\nSteeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution\\nof inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly\\nsuspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by\\nbringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon\\'s wife, and Marianne as\\n_their_ visitor.\\n\\nFanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had\\nprocured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company\\nand her sister\\'s, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady\\nMiddleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and\\nreasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,\\nherself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such\\nan opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all\\nthings, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the\\nmost gratifying to her feelings! It was an advantage that could not\\nbe too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the\\nvisit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,\\nwas instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days\\'\\ntime.\\n\\nWhen the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after\\nits arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the\\nexpectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed\\non so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will\\ntowards her arose from something more than merely malice against\\nherself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing\\nthat Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady\\nMiddleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John\\nDashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of\\ngreater.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor\\nof their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.\\nSir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such\\naccounts of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.\\nMrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in\\nher life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book\\nmade by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not\\nknow whether she should ever be able to part with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother\\nfelt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her;\\nand, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day,\\nreturned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in\\nwhich she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former\\nshare.\\n\\nAbout the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in\\nBerkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit\\nto Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by\\nherself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to\\nhear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,\\nbegan directly to justify it, by saying--\\n\\n\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am. What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.\\nPalmer\\'s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was\\nsure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\\nSo I looked at it directly, and, \\'Lord! my dear,\\' says I, \\'it is\\nnothing in the world, but the red gum--\\' and nurse said just the same.\\nBut Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent\\nfor; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\\nstepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said\\njust as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and\\nthen Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it\\ncame into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of\\nit, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon\\nthat, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know\\nsomething or other, and at last he said in a whisper, \\'For fear any\\nunpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to\\ntheir sister\\'s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I\\nbelieve there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will\\ndo very well.\\'\"\\n\\n\"What! is Fanny ill?\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _In a whisper._]\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I said, my dear. \\'Lord!\\' says I, \\'is Mrs.\\nDashwood ill?\\' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of\\nthe matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,\\nthe very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\\nturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.\\nEdward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to\\nmy cousin Lucy! There\\'s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a\\nsyllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a\\nthing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody\\nsuspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,\\nor I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this\\nwas kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor\\nyour brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very\\nmorning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no\\nconjurer, popt it all out. \\'Lord!\\' thinks she to herself, \\'they are\\nall so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about\\nit;\\' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone\\nat her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had\\njust been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she\\nthought to make a match between Edward and some Lord\\'s daughter or\\nother, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her\\nvanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with\\nsuch screams as reached your brother\\'s ears, as he was sitting in his\\nown dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his\\nsteward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene\\ntook place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\\nwhat was going on. Poor soul! I pity _her._ And I must say, I think\\nshe was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and\\nsoon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees,\\nand cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and\\nsaid he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should\\nnot stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to\\ngo down upon _his_ knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till\\nthey had packed up their clothes. _Then_ she fell into hysterics\\nagain, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\\nand Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was\\nat the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just\\nstepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\\nshe could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I\\nhave no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it\\nwill be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward\\nwill be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully!\\nfor they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not\\nwonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan\\nthinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and\\nthe best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that\\nhe may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was\\nsent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister\\nwas sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I\\ncare. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people\\'s\\nmaking such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on\\nearth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs.\\nFerrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has\\nnext to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make\\nthe most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow\\nhim five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it\\nas any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in\\nsuch another cottage as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and\\ntwo men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty\\nhas a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.\"\\n\\nHere Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to\\ncollect her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make\\nsuch observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to\\nproduce. Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\\ninterest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped\\nmight be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to\\nEdward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she\\nfelt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and\\nto give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the\\nconduct of every one concerned in it.\\n\\nShe could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event\\nreally was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its\\nbeing possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of\\nEdward and Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there\\ncould not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still\\nmore anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself. For _him_ she\\nfelt much compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some\\npains to procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\\n\\nAs Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the\\nnecessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be\\nlost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,\\nand in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any\\nresentment against Edward.\\n\\nElinor\\'s office was a painful one. She was going to remove what she\\nreally believed to be her sister\\'s chief consolation,--to give such\\nparticulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her\\ngood opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their\\nsituations, which to _her_ fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\\ndisappointment over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it\\nwas necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.\\n\\nShe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to\\nrepresent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the\\nself-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward\\'s\\nengagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\\nHer narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given\\nwithout emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor\\nimpetuous grief. _That_ belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne\\nlistened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the\\ncomforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and\\nall the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure\\nof mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge\\nbut of imprudence, was readily offered.\\n\\nBut Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed\\na second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she _had_\\nloved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for\\nLucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded\\nat first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of\\nEdward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and\\nElinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only\\ncould convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.\\n\\nHer first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact\\nof the engagement, and the length of time it had existed. Marianne\\'s\\nfeelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of\\ndetail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her\\ndistress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment. The first\\nquestion on her side, which led to farther particulars, was--\\n\\n\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?\"\\n\\n\"I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton\\nPark last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.\"\\n\\nAt these words, Marianne\\'s eyes expressed the astonishment which her\\nlips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"\\n\\nElinor confirmed it.\\n\\n\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your\\nheart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!\"--\\n\\n\"It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!\"\\n\\n\"Four months!\" cried Marianne again. \"So calm! so cheerful! how have\\nyou been supported?\"\\n\\n\"By feeling that I was doing my duty. My promise to Lucy, obliged me\\nto be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of\\nthe truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in\\nthem a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to\\nsatisfy.\"\\n\\nMarianne seemed much struck.\\n\\n\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,\" added\\nElinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it; but without betraying\\nmy trust, I never could have convinced you.\"\\n\\n\"Four months! and yet you loved him!\"\\n\\n\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others\\nwas dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.\\nNow, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have\\nyou suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer\\nmaterially myself. I have many things to support me. I am not\\nconscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of\\nmy own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it\\nfarther. I acquit Edward of essential misconduct. I wish him very\\nhappy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now\\nhe may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. Lucy does\\nnot want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing good\\nmay be built. And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in\\nthe idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said\\nof one\\'s happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is\\nnot meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.\\nEdward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and\\nunderstanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to\\nforget that he ever thought another superior to _her._\"\\n\\n\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne, \"if the loss of what\\nis most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your\\nresolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\\nwondered at. They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For\\nfour months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without\\nbeing at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it\\nwould make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\\nto you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told\\nme,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose\\nprior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,\\nwith triumph. This person\\'s suspicions, therefore, I have had to\\noppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\\ndeeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her\\nhopes and exultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself\\nto be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance\\nthat could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him\\nunworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had\\nto contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of\\nhis mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without\\nenjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time,\\nwhen, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If\\nyou can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that\\nI have suffered _now._ The composure of mind with which I have brought\\nmyself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have\\nbeen willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful\\nexertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to\\nrelieve my spirits at first. No, Marianne. _Then_, if I had not been\\nbound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not\\neven what I owed to my dearest friends--from openly showing that I was\\n_very_ unhappy.\"--\\n\\nMarianne was quite subdued.\\n\\n\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate myself for ever. How\\nbarbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who\\nhave borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only\\nsuffering for me! Is this my gratitude? Is this the only return I can\\nmake you? Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying\\nto do it away.\"\\n\\nThe tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of\\nmind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her\\nwhatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of\\nbitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of\\ndislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should\\nbring them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.\\nThese were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had\\ninjured, no reparation could be too much for her to make.\\n\\nShe performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration. She\\nattended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with\\nan unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard\\nthree times to say, \"Yes, ma\\'am.\"--She listened to her praise of Lucy\\nwith only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings\\ntalked of Edward\\'s affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.\\nSuch advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to\\nany thing herself.\\n\\nThe next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their\\nbrother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful\\naffair, and bring them news of his wife.\\n\\n\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity, as soon as\\nhe was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery that took place under\\nour roof yesterday.\"\\n\\nThey all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_You have heard, I suppose._\"]\\n\\n\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars\\ntoo--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but\\nI will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of\\nus quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But\\nI would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing\\nmaterially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her\\nresolution equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the\\nfortitude of an angel! She says she never shall think well of anybody\\nagain; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting\\nwith such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much\\nconfidence had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her\\nheart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely\\nbecause she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\\nwell-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we\\nboth wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us,\\nwhile your kind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to\\nbe so rewarded! \\'I wish, with all my heart,\\' says poor Fanny in her\\naffectionate way, \\'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.\\'\"\\n\\nHere he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.\\n\\n\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is\\nnot to be described. While she with the truest affection had been\\nplanning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed\\nthat he could be all the time secretly engaged to another\\nperson!--such a suspicion could never have entered her head! If she\\nsuspected _any_ prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_\\nquarter. \\'_There_ to be sure,\\' said she, \\'I might have thought myself\\nsafe.\\' She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as\\nto what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.\\nHe came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars\\ncould say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as\\nyou may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny\\'s entreaties, was of\\nno avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never\\nthought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained\\nto him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told\\nhim she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of\\nland-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\\ngrew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this,\\nif he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the\\ncertain penury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds\\nshe protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so\\nfar would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if\\nhe were to enter into any profession with a view of better support,\\nshe would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.\"\\n\\nHere Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands\\ntogether, and cried, \"Gracious God! can this be possible!\"\\n\\n\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother, \"at the\\nobstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation\\nis very natural.\"\\n\\nMarianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and\\nforbore.\\n\\n\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain. Edward said\\nvery little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.\\nNothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would\\nstand to it, cost him what it might.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be\\nsilent, \"he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.\\nDashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a\\nrascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as\\nyourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a\\nbetter kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good\\nhusband.\"\\n\\nJohn Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not\\nopen to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially\\nanybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any\\nresentment--\\n\\n\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,\\nmadam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,\\nbut in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.\\nAnd to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under\\nher uncle\\'s care, the son of a woman especially of such very large\\nfortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little\\nextraordinary. In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour\\nof any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We all wish\\nher extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct throughout the whole,\\nhas been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like\\ncircumstances, would adopt. It has been dignified and liberal. Edward\\nhas drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one.\"\\n\\nMarianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor\\'s heart wrung\\nfor the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother\\'s threats, for a\\nwoman who could not reward him.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say, ma\\'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--Edward is\\ndismissed for ever from his mother\\'s notice. He left her house\\nyesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do\\nnot know; for _we_ of course can make no inquiry.\"\\n\\n\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\\n\\n\"What, indeed, ma\\'am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the\\nprospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more\\ndeplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on\\nit?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but\\nfor his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two\\nthousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand\\npounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must\\nall feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our\\npower to assist him.\"\\n\\n\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure he should be very\\nwelcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I\\ncould see him. It is not fit that he should be living about at his own\\ncharge now, at lodgings and taverns.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though\\nshe could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\\n\\n\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\" said John Dashwood,\\n\"as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been\\nin his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it\\nis, it must be out of anybody\\'s power to assist him. And there is one\\nthing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his\\nmother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle\\n_that_ estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward\\'s,\\non proper conditions. I left her this morning with her lawyer,\\ntalking over the business.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Talking over the business._]\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is _her_ revenge. Everybody has a\\nway of their own. But I don\\'t think mine would be, to make one son\\nindependent, because another had plagued me.\"\\n\\nMarianne got up and walked about the room.\\n\\n\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\" continued John,\\n\"than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which\\nmight have been his own? Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely.\"\\n\\nA few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his\\nvisit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really\\nbelieved there was no material danger in Fanny\\'s indisposition, and\\nthat they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present\\noccasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct, the\\nDashwoods\\', and Edward\\'s.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and\\nas her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in\\nMrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the\\nparty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward\\'s conduct, but\\nonly Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. _They_ only knew\\nhow little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small\\nwas the consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that\\ncould remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried\\nin his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion\\nfor his punishment. But though confidence between them was, by this\\npublic discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject\\non which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor\\navoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her\\nthoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that\\nbelief of Edward\\'s continued affection for herself which she rather\\nwished to do away; and Marianne\\'s courage soon failed her, in trying\\nto converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with\\nherself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between\\nElinor\\'s conduct and her own.\\n\\nShe felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had\\nhoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of\\ncontinual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never\\nexerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\\nwithout the hope of amendment. Her mind was so much weakened that she\\nstill fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only\\ndispirited her more.\\n\\nNothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs\\nin Harley Street, or Bartlett\\'s Buildings. But though so much of the\\nmatter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had\\nenough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking\\nafter more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\\nand inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the\\nhindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them\\nwithin that time.\\n\\nThe third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so\\nfine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,\\nthough it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor\\nwere of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were\\nagain in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather\\nto stay at home, than venture into so public a place.\\n\\nAn intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they\\nentered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing\\nwith them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings\\'s conversation, she was\\nherself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\\nnothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by\\nany chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at last\\nshe found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,\\nthough looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting\\nthem, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of\\nMrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their\\'s.\\nMrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor--\\n\\n\"Get it all out of her, my dear. She will tell you any thing if you\\nask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"\\n\\nIt was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings\\'s curiosity and Elinor\\'s too,\\nthat she would tell any thing _without_ being asked; for nothing would\\notherwise have been learnt.\\n\\n\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by\\nthe arm--\"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.\" And\\nthen lowering her voice, \"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about\\nit. Is she angry?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"\\n\\n\"That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is _she_ angry?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\\n\\n\"I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of\\nit! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she\\nwould never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me\\nagain, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are\\nas good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put\\nin the feather last night. There now, _you_ are going to laugh at me\\ntoo. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it _is_\\nthe Doctor\\'s favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never\\nhave known he _did_ like it better than any other colour, if he had\\nnot happened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare\\nsometimes I do not know which way to look before them.\"\\n\\nShe had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,\\nand therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to\\nthe first.\\n\\n\"Well, but Miss Dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly, \"people may say what\\nthey choose about Mr. Ferrars\\'s declaring he would not have Lucy, for\\nit is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such\\nill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think\\nabout it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set\\nit down for certain.\"\\n\\n\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,\"\\nsaid Elinor.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_She put in the feather last night._\"]\\n\\n\"Oh, did not you? But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more\\nthan one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses\\ncould expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with\\nthirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had\\nnothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides\\nthat, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point\\nhe was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come\\nnear us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I\\nbelieve in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away\\nfrom your brother\\'s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all\\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of\\nhim. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose\\nagainst that. However this morning he came just as we came home from\\nchurch; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday\\nto Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them,\\nand how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy,\\nand nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by\\nwhat passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother\\'s house,\\nhe had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or\\nother; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday,\\non purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and\\nover again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\\nand no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the\\nengagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but\\ntwo thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to\\ngo into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a\\ncuracy, and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear to\\nthink of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least\\nmind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift\\nfor himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\\nAnd it was entirely for _her_ sake, and upon _her_ account, that he\\nsaid a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath\\nhe never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to\\nmarry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would\\nnot give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a\\ngreat deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that--Oh, la! one\\ncan\\'t repeat such kind of things you know)--she told him directly, she\\nhad not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with\\nhim upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be\\nvery glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then\\nhe was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should\\ndo, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait\\nto be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any\\nmore, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was\\ncome in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so\\nI was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if\\nshe would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just\\nrun up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with\\nthe Richardsons.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\" said Elinor;\\n\"you were all in the same room together, were not you?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love\\nwhen any body else is by? Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know\\nbetter than that. (Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in\\nthe drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at\\nthe door.\"\\n\\n\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me what you only\\nlearnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it\\nbefore; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me\\nparticulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known\\nyourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, la! there is nothing in _that._ I only stood at the door, and\\nheard what I could. And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same\\nby me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many\\nsecrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or\\nbehind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"\\n\\nElinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be\\nkept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Listening at the door._]\\n\\n\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she; \"but now he is\\nlodging at No. --, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is,\\nan\\'t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I\\nshan\\'t say anything against them to _you_; and to be sure they did\\nsend us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.\\nAnd for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask\\nus for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,\\nnothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of\\nsight. Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go\\nthere for a time; and after _that_, as soon as he can light upon a\\nBishop, he will be ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get! Good\\ngracious! (giggling as she spoke) I\\'d lay my life I know what my\\ncousins will say, when they hear of it. They will tell me I should\\nwrite to the Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living. I\\nknow they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the\\nworld. \\'La!\\' I shall say directly, \\'I wonder how you could think of\\nsuch a thing? I write to the Doctor, indeed!\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared against the\\nworst. You have got your answer ready.\"\\n\\nMiss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach\\nof her own party made another more necessary.\\n\\n\"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to\\nyou, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you\\nthey are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and\\nthey keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings\\nabout it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not\\nin anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything\\nshould happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings\\nshould want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay\\nwith her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton\\nwon\\'t ask us any more this bout. Good-bye; I am sorry Miss Marianne was\\nnot here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your\\nspotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.\"\\n\\nSuch was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay\\nher farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was\\nclaimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of\\nknowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though\\nshe had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen\\nand foreplanned in her own mind. Edward\\'s marriage with Lucy was as\\nfirmly determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as\\nabsolutely uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;--every thing\\ndepended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting that\\npreferment, of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest\\nchance.\\n\\nAs soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for\\ninformation; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible\\nintelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,\\nshe confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple\\nparticulars, as she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own\\nconsequence, would choose to have known. The continuance of their\\nengagement, and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its\\nend, was all her communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings\\nthe following natural remark:--\\n\\n\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how _that_ will\\nend:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,\\nwill set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest\\nof his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.\\nPratt can give her. Then they will have a child every year! and Lord\\nhelp \\'em! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them\\ntowards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I\\ntalked of t\\'other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all\\nworks. Betty\\'s sister would never do for them _now._\"\\n\\nThe next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from\\nLucy herself. It was as follows:\\n\\n\"Bartlett\\'s Building, March.\\n\\n     \"I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take\\n     of writing to her; but I know your friendship for me will\\n     make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and\\n     my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have went through\\n     lately, therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed\\n     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered dreadfully,\\n     we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always\\n     be in one another\\'s love. We have had great trials, and\\n     great persecutions, but however, at the same time,\\n     gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least\\n     among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully\\n     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of it. I am\\n     sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs.\\n     Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday\\n     afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though\\n     earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to\\n     it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the\\n     spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never\\n     be, he did not regard his mother\\'s anger, while he could\\n     have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be\\n     sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be\\n     ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to\\n     recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am\\n     very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings\\n     too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or\\n     Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.\\n     Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it\\n     for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won\\'t\\n     think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come\\n     this way any morning, \\'twould be a great kindness, and my\\n     cousins would be proud to know her. My paper reminds me to\\n     conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully\\n     remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and\\n     the dear children, when you chance to see them, and love to\\n     Miss Marianne,\\n\\n\"I am, etc., etc.\"\\n\\nAs soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to\\nbe its writer\\'s real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.\\nJennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and\\npraise.\\n\\n\"Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite\\nproper to let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy. Poor\\nsoul! I wish I _could_ get him a living, with all my heart. She calls\\nme dear Mrs. Jennings, you see. She is a good-hearted girl as ever\\nlived. Very well upon my word. That sentence is very prettily turned.\\nYes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to\\nthink of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for showing it me. It is as\\npretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy\\'s head and heart great\\ncredit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX\\n\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,\\nand Marianne\\'s impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed\\nfor the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that\\nif any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly\\nless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less\\nbent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of\\nthe difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be\\nbrought to acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her\\nthoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their\\nwishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence\\nof her good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining\\nthem from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether\\nmuch more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to\\nCleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs.\\nJennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from\\nCharlotte to go with them. This would not, in itself, have been\\nsufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was enforced\\nwith so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the\\nvery great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had\\nbeen known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.\\n\\nWhen she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was\\nnot very auspicious.\\n\\n\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation. \"No, I cannot go to\\nCleveland.\"--\\n\\n\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation is not--that it\\nis not in the neighbourhood of--\"\\n\\n\"But it is in Somersetshire. I cannot go into Somersetshire. There,\\nwhere I looked forward to going;--no, Elinor, you cannot expect me to\\ngo there.\"\\n\\nElinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such\\nfeelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on\\nothers;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the\\ntime of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to\\nsee, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan\\ncould do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which\\nwas within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not\\nbeyond one day, though a long day\\'s journey; and their mother\\'s\\nservant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there\\ncould be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they\\nmight now be at home in little more than three weeks\\' time. As\\nMarianne\\'s affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with\\nlittle difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest, that she\\npressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.\\nElinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her\\ndesign; and their mother\\'s concurrence being readily gained, every\\nthing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could\\nbe;--and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the\\nhours that were yet to divide her from Barton.\\n\\n\"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss\\nDashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings\\'s address to him when he first called\\non her, after their leaving her was settled--\"for they are quite\\nresolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall\\nbe, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as\\ndull as two cats.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their\\nfuture ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give\\nhimself an escape from it; and if so, she had soon afterwards good\\nreason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor\\'s moving to the\\nwindow to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she\\nwas going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of\\nparticular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.\\nThe effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her\\nobservation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\\nchanged her seat, on purpose that she might _not_ hear, to one close\\nby the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep\\nherself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with\\nagitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her\\nemployment. Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the\\ninterval of Marianne\\'s turning from one lesson to another, some words\\nof the Colonel\\'s inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be\\napologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a\\ndoubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;\\nbut supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply\\nshe could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips,\\nthat she did not think _that_ any material objection;--and Mrs.\\nJennings commended her in her heart for being so honest. They then\\ntalked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable,\\nwhen another lucky stop in Marianne\\'s performance brought her these\\nwords in the Colonel\\'s calm voice,--\\n\\n\"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"\\n\\nAstonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost\\nready to cry out, \"Lord! what should hinder it?\"--but checking her\\ndesire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.\\n\\n\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\\n\\nThis delay on the Colonel\\'s side, however, did not seem to offend or\\nmortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the\\nconference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings\\nvery plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which showed her to\\nfeel what she said--\\n\\n\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that\\nafter hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take\\nleave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and\\ngo away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old\\nfriend could have made so indifferent a suitor.\\n\\nWhat had really passed between them was to this effect.\\n\\n\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion, \"of the injustice your\\nfriend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand\\nthe matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for\\npersevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have\\nI been rightly informed?--Is it so?--\"\\n\\nElinor told him that it was.\\n\\n\"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied, with great\\nfeeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people\\nlong attached to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know\\nwhat she may be doing--what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr.\\nFerrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with\\nhim. He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted\\nin a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for\\nhis own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I\\nunderstand that he intends to take orders. Will you be so good as to\\ntell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am\\ninformed by this day\\'s post, is his, if he think it worth his\\nacceptance--but _that_, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he\\nis now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were\\nmore valuable. It is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I\\nbelieve, did not make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is\\ncertainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to\\nafford him a very comfortable income. Such as it is, however, my\\npleasure in presenting him to it, will be very great. Pray assure him\\nof it.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been\\ngreater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.\\nThe preferment, which only two days before she had considered as\\nhopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--and\\n_she_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her\\nemotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different\\ncause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might\\nhave a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,\\nand her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together\\nprompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly\\nexpressed. She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of\\nEdward\\'s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew\\nthem to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with\\npleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\\nto another. But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no\\none could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short,\\nfrom which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an\\nobligation from _her_, she would have been very glad to be spared\\nherself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining\\nit likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her\\nmeans, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.\\nEdward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard\\nhis address from Miss Steele. She could undertake therefore to inform\\nhim of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled,\\nColonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so\\nrespectable and agreeable a neighbour, and _then_ it was that he\\nmentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent; an\\nevil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very\\nlight of, at least as far as regarded its size.\\n\\n\"The smallness of the house,\" said she, \"I cannot imagine any\\ninconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family\\nand income.\"\\n\\nBy which the Colonel was surprised to find that _she_ was considering\\nMr. Ferrars\\'s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation;\\nfor he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply\\nsuch an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to\\nsettle on, and he said so.\\n\\n\"This little rectory _can_ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars\\ncomfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry\\nto say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly\\nmore extensive. If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in\\nmy power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him\\nfrom what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I\\nsincerely wish I could be at present. What I am now doing indeed,\\nseems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little towards what\\nmust be his principal, his only object of happiness. His marriage must\\nstill be a distant good;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place\\nvery soon.\"\\n\\nSuch was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended\\nthe delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of\\nwhat really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they\\nstood at the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their\\nparting, may perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,\\nnor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of\\nmarriage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as\\nsoon as the gentleman had withdrawn, \"I do not ask you what the\\nColonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I _tried_\\nto keep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand\\nhis business. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,\\nand I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor. \"It is a matter of great joy to me;\\nand I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are\\nnot many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so\\ncompassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an\\'t the least astonished at it\\nin the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more\\nlikely to happen.\"\\n\\n\"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel\\'s general benevolence;\\nbut at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very\\nsoon occur.\"\\n\\n\"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that, when a man has\\nonce made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon\\nfind an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and\\nagain; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I\\nshall soon know where to look for them.\"\\n\\n\"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\" said Elinor, with a\\nfaint smile.\\n\\n\"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one,\\nI do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as\\never I saw.\"\\n\\n\"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and whose fault is that? why don\\'t he repair it? who should do\\nit but himself?\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the servant\\'s coming in to announce the\\ncarriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to\\ngo, said--\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.\\nBut, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be\\nquite alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind\\nis too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\\nlong to tell your sister all about it.\"\\n\\nMarianne had left the room before the conversation began.\\n\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not\\nmention it at present to any body else.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very well,\" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. \"Then you\\nwould not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as\\nHolborn to-day.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, not even Lucy if you please. One day\\'s delay will not be\\nvery material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it\\nought not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do _that_\\ndirectly. It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\\nfor he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination.\"\\n\\nThis speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr.\\nFerrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she\\ncould not immediately comprehend. A few moments\\' reflection, however,\\nproduced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Oh, ho! I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much\\nthe better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness;\\nand I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my\\ndear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel\\nwrite himself? Sure, he is the proper person.\"\\n\\nElinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nspeech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore\\nonly replied to its conclusion.\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one\\nto announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.\"\\n\\n\"And so _you_ are forced to do it. Well _that_ is an odd kind of\\ndelicacy! However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to\\nwrite.) You know your own concerns best. So good-bye, my dear. I have\\nnot heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was\\nbrought to bed.\"\\n\\nAnd away she went; but returning again in a moment--\\n\\n\"I have just been thinking of Betty\\'s sister, my dear. I should be\\nvery glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for\\na lady\\'s maid, I am sure I can\\'t tell. She is an excellent housemaid,\\nand works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that\\nat your leisure.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,\\nand more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.\\n\\nHow she should begin--how she should express herself in her note to\\nEdward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between\\nthem made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have\\nbeen the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too\\nmuch or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen\\nin her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\\n\\nHe had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he\\ncame to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not\\nreturning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss\\nDashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular\\nbusiness.\\n\\nElinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her\\nperplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself\\nproperly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the\\ninformation by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her\\nupon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion\\nwere very great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him\\nbefore since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his\\nknowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of\\nwhat she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her\\nfeel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much\\ndistressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of\\nembarrassment. Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on\\nfirst coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to\\nbe on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could\\nsay any thing, after taking a chair.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished to speak with me,\\nat least I understood her so--or I certainly should not have intruded\\non you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been\\nextremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\\nespecially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable\\nthat I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to\\nOxford tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor, recovering herself,\\nand determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as\\npossible, \"without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been\\nable to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she\\nsaid. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on\\nthe point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most\\nagreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)\\nColonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to\\nsay, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure\\nin offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only\\nwishes it were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having\\nso respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\\nthe living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more\\nconsiderable, and such as might better enable you to--as might be more\\nthan a temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might\\nestablish all your views of happiness.\"\\n\\nWhat Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be\\nexpected that any one else should say for him. He _looked_ all the\\nastonishment which such unexpected, such unthought-of information\\ncould not fail of exciting; but he said only these two words--\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the\\nworst was over, \"Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his\\nconcern for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which\\nthe unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern\\nwhich I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share;\\nand likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character,\\nand his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present\\noccasion.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon give _me_ a living!--Can it be possible?\"\\n\\n\"The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find\\nfriendship any where.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to find it in _you_;\\nfor I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.\\nI feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know, I am\\nno orator.\"\\n\\n\"You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely,\\nat least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon\\'s\\ndiscernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till\\nI understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever\\noccurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a\\nfriend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he _has_,\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe\\nnothing to my solicitation.\"\\n\\nTruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but\\nshe was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of\\nEdward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably\\ncontributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently\\nentered it. For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had\\nceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. I have\\nalways heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems\\nhim highly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners\\nperfectly the gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him, on\\nfarther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you\\nwill be such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is\\nalmost close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that\\nhe _should_ be all this.\"\\n\\nEdward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her\\na look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that\\nhe might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the\\nmansion-house much greater.\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\" said he, soon\\nafterwards, rising from his chair.\\n\\nElinor told him the number of the house.\\n\\n\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not\\nallow me to give _you_; to assure him that he has made me a very--an\\nexceedingly happy man.\"\\n\\nElinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very\\nearnest assurance on _her_ side of her unceasing good wishes for his\\nhappiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on\\n_his_, with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the\\npower of expressing it.\\n\\n\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him\\nout, \"I shall see him the husband of Lucy.\"\\n\\nAnd with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the\\npast, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of\\nEdward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.\\n\\nWhen Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people\\nwhom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a\\ngreat deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important\\nsecret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to\\nit again as soon as Elinor appeared.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up the young man. Did not I do\\nright?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find\\nhim very unwilling to accept your proposal?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am; _that_ was not very likely.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon\\nthat.\"\\n\\n\"Really,\" said Elinor, \"I know so little of these kind of forms, that\\nI can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation\\nnecessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his\\nordination.\"\\n\\n\"Two or three months!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"Lord! my dear, how calmly\\nyou talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord\\nbless me!--I am sure it would put _me_ quite out of patience!--And\\nthough one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I\\ndo think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.\\nSure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that\\nis in orders already.\"\\n\\n\"My dear ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of? Why,\\nColonel Brandon\\'s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the\\nColonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.\\nFerrars!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Both gained considerable amusement_]\\n\\nThe deception could not continue after this; and an explanation\\nimmediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement\\nfor the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for\\nMrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and\\nstill without forfeiting her expectation of the first.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she, after the\\nfirst ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, \"and very\\nlikely _may_ be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I\\nthought, for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on\\nthe ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up\\nfifteen beds! and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton\\ncottage! It seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the\\nColonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for\\nthem, before Lucy goes to it.\"\\n\\n\"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living\\'s\\nbeing enough to allow them to marry.\"\\n\\n\"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year\\nhimself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word\\nfor it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford\\nParsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan\\'t go if Lucy an\\'t\\nthere.\"\\n\\nElinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not\\nwaiting for any thing more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI\\n\\n\\nEdward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with\\nhis happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he\\nreached Bartlett\\'s Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.\\nJennings, who called on her again the next day with her\\ncongratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in\\nher life.\\n\\nHer own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain;\\nand she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their\\nbeing all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before\\nMichaelmas. So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to\\ngive Elinor that credit which Edward _would_ give her, that she spoke\\nof her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was\\nready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no\\nexertion for their good on Miss Dashwood\\'s part, either present or\\nfuture, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing\\nany thing in the world for those she really valued. As for Colonel\\nBrandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was\\nmoreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly\\nconcerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and\\nsecretly resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she\\npossibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his\\npoultry.\\n\\nIt was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley\\nStreet, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his\\nwife\\'s indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel\\nit necessary to pay her a visit. This was an obligation, however,\\nwhich not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the\\nassistance of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, not\\ncontented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to\\nprevent her sister\\'s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her\\ncarriage was always at Elinor\\'s service, so very much disliked Mrs.\\nJohn Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after\\nthe late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking\\nEdward\\'s part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company\\nagain. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a\\nvisit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run\\nthe risk of a tÍte-‡-tÍte with a woman, whom neither of the others had\\nso much reason to dislike.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the\\nhouse, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure\\nin meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in\\nBerkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to\\nsee her, invited her to come in.\\n\\nThey walked up stairs in to the drawing-room. Nobody was there.\\n\\n\"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\" said he:--\"I will go to her\\npresently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the\\nworld to seeing _you._ Very far from it, indeed. _Now_ especially\\nthere cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great\\nfavourites. Why would not Marianne come?\"--\\n\\nElinor made what excuse she could for her.\\n\\n\"I am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied, \"for I have a good deal\\nto say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon\\'s--can it be true?--has\\nhe really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\\n\\n\"It is perfectly true. Colonel Brandon has given the living of\\nDelaford to Edward.\"\\n\\n\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no\\nconnection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a\\nprice!--what was the value of this?\"\\n\\n\"About two hundred a year.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that\\nvalue--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and\\nlikely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen\\nhundred pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before\\nthis person\\'s death? _Now_ indeed it would be too late to sell it, but\\na man of Colonel Brandon\\'s sense!--I wonder he should be so\\nimprovident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I\\nam convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost\\nevery human character. I suppose, however--on recollection--that the\\ncase may probably be _this._ Edward is only to hold the living till\\nthe person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is\\nold enough to take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\\n\\nElinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that\\nshe had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel\\nBrandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which\\nit was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\\n\\n\"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing what she\\nsaid--\"what could be the Colonel\\'s motive?\"\\n\\n\"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky\\nman. You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I\\nhave broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like\\nto hear it much talked of.\"\\n\\nElinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she\\nthought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of\\nwealth to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be\\npossibly impoverished.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so\\nimportant a subject, \"knows nothing about it at present, and I believe\\nit will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may\\nbe. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.\"\\n\\n\"But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be\\nsupposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in\\nknowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for _that_ must\\nbe quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she\\nsupposed to feel at all? She has done with her son, she cast him off\\nfor ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast\\nhim off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined\\nliable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she\\ncannot be interested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be\\nso weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the\\nanxiety of a parent!\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good, but it is\\nfounded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward\\'s unhappy match\\ntakes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had\\nnever discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may\\naccelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as\\npossible. Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\"\\n\\n\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her\\nmemory by _this_ time.\"\\n\\n\"You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most\\naffectionate mothers in the world.\"\\n\\nElinor was silent.\\n\\n\"We think _now_,\"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, \"of\\n_Robert\\'s_ marrying Miss Morton.\"\\n\\nElinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother\\'s\\ntone, calmly replied--\\n\\n\"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"Choice!--how do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be\\nthe same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all\\nintents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any\\nthing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that\\none is superior to the other.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent. His\\nreflections ended thus.\\n\\n\"Of _one_ thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand, and speaking\\nin an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you; and I _will_ do it, because I\\nknow it must gratify you. I have good reason to think--indeed I have\\nit from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise\\nit would be very wrong to say any thing about it,--but I have it from\\nthe very best authority,--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars\\nsay it herself--but her daughter _did_, and I have it from her,--that\\nin short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a\\ncertain connection, you understand me,--it would have been far\\npreferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that\\n_this_ does. I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars\\nconsidered it in that light; a very gratifying circumstance you know\\nto us all. \\'It would have been beyond comparison,\\' she said, \\'the\\nleast evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound _now_ for\\nnothing worse.\\' But however, all that is quite out of the\\nquestion,--not to be thought of or mentioned. As to any attachment you\\nknow, it never could be; all that is gone by. But I thought I would\\njust tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not\\nthat you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor. There is no doubt\\nof your doing exceedingly well,--quite as well, or better, perhaps,\\nall things considered. Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?\"\\n\\nElinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her\\nself-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was\\ntherefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply\\nherself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her\\nbrother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments\\'\\nchat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her\\nsister\\'s being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was\\nleft to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay\\nunconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so\\nunfair a division of his mother\\'s love and liberality, to the\\nprejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated\\ncourse of life, and that brother\\'s integrity, was confirming her most\\nunfavourable opinion of his head and heart.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_Of one thing I may assure you._\"]\\n\\nThey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to\\nspeak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very\\ninquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as\\nshe had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very\\ndifferent, was not less striking than it had been on _him._ He laughed\\nmost immoderately. The idea of Edward\\'s being a clergyman, and living\\nin a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to\\nthat was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a\\nwhite surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John\\nSmith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\\n\\nElinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the\\nconclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed\\non him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a\\nlook, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,\\nand gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\\nnot by any reproof of her\\'s, but by his own sensibility.\\n\\n\"We may treat it as a joke,\" said he, at last, recovering from the\\naffected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine\\ngaiety of the moment; \"but, upon my soul, it is a most serious\\nbusiness. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for\\nit; for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature,--as\\nwell-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge\\nof him, Miss Dashwood, from _your_ slight acquaintance. Poor Edward!\\nHis manners are certainly not the happiest in nature. But we are not\\nall born, you know, with the same powers,--the same address. Poor\\nfellow! to see him in a circle of strangers! to be sure it was\\npitiable enough; but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as\\nany in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so\\nshocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe\\nit. My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling\\nmyself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her,--\\'My\\ndear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion,\\nbut as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young\\nwoman, I never will see him again.\\' That was what I said immediately.\\nI was most uncommonly shocked, indeed! Poor Edward! he has done for\\nhimself completely,--shut himself out for ever from all decent\\nsociety! but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least\\nsurprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be\\nexpected. My poor mother was half frantic.\"\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen the lady?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in\\nfor ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkward\\ncountry girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I\\nremember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely\\nto captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother\\nrelated the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from\\nthe match; but it was too late _then_, I found, to do any thing, for\\nunluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till\\nafter the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to\\ninterfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think\\nit is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly\\nshould have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. \\'My dear\\nfellow,\\' I should have said, \\'consider what you are doing. You are\\nmaking a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family\\nare unanimous in disapproving.\\' I cannot help thinking, in short, that\\nmeans might have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be\\nstarved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved.\"\\n\\nHe had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance\\nof Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though _she_\\nnever spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its\\ninfluence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance\\nwith which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour\\nto herself. She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that\\nElinor and her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to\\nsee more of them;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her\\ninto the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to\\ndistinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII\\n\\n\\nOne other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her\\nbrother\\'s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton\\nwithout any expense, and on Colonel Brandon\\'s being to follow them to\\nCleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother\\nand sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to\\nNorland whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all\\nthings was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less\\npublic, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which\\nhe should come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any\\nmeeting in the country.\\n\\nIt amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to\\nsend her to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she would now\\nleast choose to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it\\nconsidered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but\\neven Lucy, when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit\\nher there.\\n\\nVery early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties\\nfrom Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective\\nhomes, to meet, by appointment, on the road. For the convenience of\\nCharlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their\\njourney, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel\\nBrandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.\\n\\nMarianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as\\nshe had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point,\\nbid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed\\nthose hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now\\nextinguished for ever, without great pain. Nor could she leave the\\nplace in which Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new\\nschemes, in which _she_ could have no share, without shedding many\\ntears.\\n\\nElinor\\'s satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.\\nShe had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left\\nno creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment\\'s regret to\\nbe divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the\\npersecution of Lucy\\'s friendship, she was grateful for bringing her\\nsister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked\\nforward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might\\ndo towards restoring Marianne\\'s peace of mind, and confirming her own.\\n\\nTheir journey was safely performed. The second day brought them into\\nthe cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was\\nit dwelt on by turns in Marianne\\'s imagination; and in the forenoon of\\nthe third they drove up to Cleveland.\\n\\nCleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping\\nlawn. It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably\\nextensive; and like every other place of the same degree of\\nimportance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of\\nsmooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn\\nwas dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the\\nguardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick\\nscreen of them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,\\nshut out the offices.\\n\\nMarianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the\\nconsciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty\\nfrom Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its\\nwalls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her\\nchild to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through\\nthe winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a\\ndistant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering\\nover a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on\\nthe farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their\\nsummits Combe Magna might be seen.\\n\\nIn such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears\\nof agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different\\ncircuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country\\nliberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious\\nsolitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while\\nshe remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary\\nrambles.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Showing her child to the housekeeper._]\\n\\nShe returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the\\nhouse, on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the\\nrest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the\\nkitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to\\nthe gardener\\'s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the\\ngreen-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,\\nand nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of\\nCharlotte,--and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the\\ndisappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests,\\nor being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising\\nyoung brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.\\n\\nThe morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment\\nabroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay\\nat Cleveland. With great surprise therefore, did she find herself\\nprevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had\\ndepended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all\\nover the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have\\ndeterred her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even _she_ could\\nnot fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking.\\n\\nTheir party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. Mrs. Palmer\\nhad her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the\\nfriends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton\\'s engagements,\\nand wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\\nthan Reading that night. Elinor, however little concerned in it,\\njoined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding\\nher way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by\\nthe family in general, soon procured herself a book.\\n\\nNothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer\\'s side that constant and friendly\\ngood humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The\\nopenness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want\\nof recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the\\nforms of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face,\\nwas engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it\\nwas not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her\\nlaugh.\\n\\n[Illustration: _The gardener\\'s lamentations._]\\n\\nThe two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner,\\naffording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome\\nvariety to their conversation, which a long morning of the same\\ncontinued rain had reduced very low.\\n\\nElinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen\\nso much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she\\nknew not what to expect to find him in his own family. She found him,\\nhowever, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\\nand only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him\\nvery capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from\\nbeing so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much\\nsuperior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.\\nJennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character and habits, they\\nwere marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all\\nunusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating,\\nuncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight\\nit; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been\\ndevoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much\\nbetter than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she\\ncould like him no more; not sorry to be driven by the observation of\\nhis epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with\\ncomplacency on the remembrance of Edward\\'s generous temper, simple\\ntaste, and diffident feelings.\\n\\nOf Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received\\nintelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire\\nlately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of\\nMr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a\\ngreat deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,\\nand told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them. His\\nbehaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his\\nopen pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his\\nreadiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,\\nmight very well justify Mrs. Jennings\\'s persuasion of his attachment,\\nand would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the\\nfirst, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it\\nherself. But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her\\nhead, except by Mrs. Jennings\\'s suggestion; and she could not help\\nbelieving herself the nicest observer of the two: she watched his\\neyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour; and while his\\nlooks of anxious solicitude on Marianne\\'s feeling, in her head and\\nthroat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,\\nentirely escaped the latter lady\\'s observation,--_she_ could discover\\nin them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.\\n\\nTwo delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her\\nbeing there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all\\nover the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,\\nwhere there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the\\ntrees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\\nhad--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet\\nshoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a\\nday or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing\\nailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\\nPrescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all\\ndeclined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a\\ncough, and a sore throat, a good night\\'s rest was to cure her\\nentirely; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her,\\nwhen she went to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the\\nremedies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII\\n\\n\\nMarianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry\\nreplied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by\\nengaging in her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting\\nshivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable\\nto read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much\\nin favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed,\\nmore and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her\\nsister\\'s composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole\\nday, against Marianne\\'s inclination, and forcing proper medicines on\\nher at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of\\nsleep, and felt no real alarm.\\n\\nA very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the\\nexpectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,\\nconfessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her\\nbed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings\\'s advice, of sending\\nfor the Palmers\\' apothecary.\\n\\nHe came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to\\nexpect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet,\\nby pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing\\nthe word \"infection\" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs.\\nPalmer, on her baby\\'s account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\\nfrom the first to think Marianne\\'s complaint more serious than Elinor,\\nnow looked very grave on Mr. Harris\\'s report, and confirming\\nCharlotte\\'s fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate\\nremoval with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their\\napprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife\\ntoo great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and\\nwithin an hour after Mr. Harris\\'s arrival, she set off, with her\\nlittle boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr.\\nPalmer\\'s, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her\\nhusband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or\\ntwo; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to\\naccompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which\\nmade Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring\\nfrom Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,\\nby her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother\\nshe had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most\\nwilling and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues,\\nand often by her better experience in nursing, of material use.\\n\\nPoor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and\\nfeeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow\\nwould find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have\\nproduced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for\\non that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended\\nthe whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their\\nmother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was\\nall in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to\\nraise her spirits, and make her believe, as she _then_ really believed\\nherself, that it would be a very short one.\\n\\nThe next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the\\npatient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no\\namendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced;\\nfor Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\\nand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away\\nby his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his\\npromise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel\\nBrandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\\nlikewise. Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most\\nacceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much\\nuneasiness on her sister\\'s account, would be to deprive them both, she\\nthought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his\\nstay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him\\nto play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with\\nher sister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was\\ngratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\\nlong even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings\\'s entreaty was\\nwarmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,\\nin leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss\\nDashwood in any emergence.\\n\\nMarianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.\\nShe knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of\\nCleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It\\ngave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it\\ngave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.\\n\\nTwo days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer\\'s departure, and her\\nsituation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who\\nattended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and\\nMiss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\\nwas by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early\\nin the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel\\nBrandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nforebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He\\ntried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of\\nthe apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day\\nin which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the\\nadmission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his\\nmind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.\\n\\nOn the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of\\nboth were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared\\nhis patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every\\nsymptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed\\nin every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her\\nletters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than\\nher friend\\'s, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed\\nthem at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would\\nbe able to travel.\\n\\nBut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the\\nevening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and\\nuncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was\\nwilling to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of\\nhaving sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the\\ncordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a\\nslumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her\\nsleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a\\nconsiderable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself,\\nshe resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings,\\nknowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to\\nbed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\\nherself in the housekeeper\\'s room, and Elinor remained alone with\\nMarianne.\\n\\nThe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her\\nsister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change\\nof posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of\\ncomplaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from\\nso painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some\\naccidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish\\nwildness, cried out,--\\n\\n\"Is mama coming?--\"\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting\\nMarianne to lie down again, \"but she will be here, I hope, before it\\nis long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.\"\\n\\n\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne, in the same\\nhurried manner. \"I shall never see her, if she goes by London.\"\\n\\nElinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while\\nattempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and\\nquicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her\\nalarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly\\nfor Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.\\nTo consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the\\nlatter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its\\nperformance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by\\nher sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he\\nwas generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.\\n\\nIt was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were\\nimmediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to\\nattempt the removal of; he listened to them in silent despondence; but\\nher difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that\\nseemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his\\nmind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs.\\nDashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She\\nthanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to\\nhurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for\\npost-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.\\n\\nThe comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or\\nsuch a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a\\ncompanion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve,\\nand whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a\\nsummons _could_ be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his\\nassistance, would lessen it.\\n\\n_He_, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness\\nof a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost\\ndespatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might\\nlook for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The\\nhorses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon\\nonly pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words\\nspoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was\\nthen about twelve o\\'clock, and she returned to her sister\\'s apartment\\nto wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the\\nrest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.\\nHour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on\\nMarianne\\'s side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor\\'s, before Mr.\\nHarris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess\\nfor all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for\\nshe would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her\\nmore, by hints of what her mistress had always thought.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her\\nmother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the\\nheart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with\\nso many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,\\nfancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had\\nbeen delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother\\narriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\\n\\nShe was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he_ could\\nnot come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after\\nfive o\\'clock--arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends\\nfor his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and\\nunpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to\\nbe material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment\\nmust procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was\\ncommunicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of\\nthree or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious\\nattendant more composed than he had found them.\\n\\nWith strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to\\ntheir aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.\\nHer former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her\\nno doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\\nher conviction of her sister\\'s danger would not allow her to offer the\\ncomfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the\\nearly death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have\\nstruck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\ncompassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her\\ncompanion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been\\ngreatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too,\\nparticularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother,\\nwhen Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to _her_\\nwhat Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was\\nvery sincere.\\n\\nMr. Harris was punctual in his second visit; but he came to be\\ndisappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His\\nmedicines had failed; the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more\\nquiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching\\nall, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in\\nfurther advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something\\nmore to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as\\nconfident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging\\nassurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of\\nMiss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\\nbut she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till\\nnoon, scarcely stirring from her sister\\'s bed, her thoughts wandering\\nfrom one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her\\nspirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\\nwho scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack\\nto the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne\\'s\\ndisappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of\\nthe idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections.\\n\\nAbout noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of\\ndisappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her\\nfriend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her\\nsister\\'s pulse; she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;\\nand at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior\\ncalmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her\\nhopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a\\ntemporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a\\nthought of its continuance; and Elinor, conning over every injunction\\nof distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late.\\nHope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she\\nbent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what. Half an hour\\npassed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even\\narose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered\\nElinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her\\nwith a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed\\nher in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the\\narrival of Mr. Harris at four o\\'clock; when his assurances, his\\nfelicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\\nexpectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\\n\\nMarianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her\\nentirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the\\npartial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their\\nlate alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\\nwith unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the\\nprobability of an entire recovery.\\n\\nElinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led\\nto any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,\\nfriends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with\\nsensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent\\ngratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\\nno smiles. All within Elinor\\'s breast was satisfaction, silent and\\nstrong.\\n\\nShe continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the\\nwhole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her\\nenfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every\\nlook and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course,\\nin some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was; but when she\\nsaw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of\\nrecovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o\\'clock sink into a quiet,\\nsteady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every\\ndoubt.\\n\\nThe time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected\\nback. At ten o\\'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her\\nmother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must\\nnow be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\\nless an object of pity! Oh! how slow was the progress of time which\\nyet kept them in ignorance!\\n\\nAt seven o\\'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined\\nMrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been\\nkept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating\\nmuch; and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of\\ncontent as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings\\nwould have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before\\nher mother\\'s arrival, and allow _her_ to take her place by Marianne;\\nbut Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that\\nmoment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an\\nunnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs\\ninto the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\\nleft her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to\\nher own room to write letters and sleep.\\n\\nThe night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and\\nthe rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,\\nregarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the\\ntravellers, they had a rich reward in store, for every present\\ninconvenience.\\n\\nThe clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been\\nconvinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the\\nhouse; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_, in spite of\\nthe _almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she moved\\ninto the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be\\nsatisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not\\ndeceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in\\nview. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be\\ndrawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor\\nmother\\'s alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.\\n\\nNever in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at\\nthat moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the\\ncarriage stopped the door,--of her doubt--her dread,--perhaps her\\ndespair!--and of what _she_ had to tell! with such knowledge it was\\nimpossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;\\nand, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings\\'s maid\\nwith her sister, she hurried down stairs.\\n\\nThe bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,\\nassured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the\\ndrawing-room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Opened a window-shutter._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIV\\n\\n\\nElinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him,\\nobeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the\\nroom, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was\\nsuspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of\\ncommand than supplication--\\n\\n\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to\\nstay.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall _not_ stay. Your\\nbusiness cannot be with _me._ The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell\\nyou that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\\n\\n\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence, \"that Mr. Palmer and all\\nhis relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the\\ndoor. My business is with you, and only you.\"\\n\\n\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement;--\"well, sir--be quick--and if you\\ncan--less violent.\"\\n\\n\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"\\n\\nShe hesitated; she knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s arriving and finding her there, came across her. But she had\\npromised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was\\nengaged. After a moment\\'s recollection, therefore, concluding that\\nprudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best\\npromote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He\\ntook the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by\\neither.\\n\\n\"Pray be quick, sir,\" said Elinor, impatiently; \"I have no time to\\nspare.\"\\n\\nHe was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to\\nhear her.\\n\\n\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--\"is out\\nof danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!--But is it\\ntrue? is it really true?\"\\n\\nElinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater\\neagerness.\\n\\n\"For God\\'s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I entreat you to stay._\"]\\n\\n\"We hope she is.\"\\n\\nHe rose up, and walked across the room.\\n\\n\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But since I _am_\\nhere,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his\\nseat,--\"what does it signify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be the\\nlast time, perhaps--let us be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood\\nfor gaiety. Tell me honestly,\"--a deeper glow overspreading his\\ncheeks, \"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\\n\\nElinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to\\nthink that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and\\nof such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this\\nimpression she immediately rose, saying--\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not\\nat leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be\\nwith me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice\\nperfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold\\nbeef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.\"\\n\\n\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand\\nwhat he would be at.\\n\\n\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o\\'clock, and the only ten\\nminutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a\\nnuncheon at Marlborough.\"\\n\\nThe steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he\\nspoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might\\nbring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she\\nsaid, after a moment\\'s recollection--\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, you _ought_ to feel, and I certainly _do_, that after\\nwhat has passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself\\nupon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that\\nyou mean by it?\"--\\n\\n\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can, to make you hate\\nme one degree less than you do _now._ I mean to offer some kind of\\nexplanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole\\nheart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a\\nblockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like\\nforgiveness from Ma----, from your sister.\"\\n\\n\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my soul it is,\" was his answer, with a warmth which brought all\\nthe former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made\\nher think him sincere.\\n\\n\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne _does_,\\nshe has _long_ forgiven you.\"\\n\\n\"Has she?\" he cried, in the same eager tone. \"Then she has forgiven me\\nbefore she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and\\non more reasonable grounds. _Now_ will you listen to me?\"\\n\\nElinor bowed her assent.\\n\\n\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation on her side,\\nand thoughtfulness on his own, \"how _you_ may have accounted for my\\nbehaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have\\nimputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\\nworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first\\nbecame intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other\\nview in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was\\nobliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done\\nbefore. Your sister\\'s lovely person and interesting manners could not\\nbut please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a\\nkind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what _she_\\nwas, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must\\nconfess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness,\\nthinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had\\nalways been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by\\nevery means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\\ndesign of returning her affection.\"\\n\\nMiss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most\\nangry contempt, stopped him, by saying--\\n\\n\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for\\nme to listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed\\nby any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the\\nsubject.\"\\n\\n\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied, \"My fortune was\\nnever large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of\\nassociating with people of better income than myself. Every year\\nsince my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my\\ndebts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set\\nme free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it\\nhad been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances\\nby marrying a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister,\\ntherefore, was not a thing to be thought of; and with a meanness,\\nselfishness, cruelty, which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even\\nof yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much,--I was acting in\\nthis manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of\\nreturning it. But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid\\nstate of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I\\nmeditated, because I did not _then_ know what it was to love. But have\\nI ever known it? Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved,\\ncould I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice? or, what is\\nmore, could I have sacrificed hers? But I have done it. To avoid a\\ncomparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have\\ndeprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,\\nlost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\\n\\n\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened, \"believe yourself at\\none time attached to her?\"\\n\\n\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!\\nIs there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself,\\nby insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours\\nof my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were\\nstrictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however,\\nwhen fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself\\nmost improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\\nfrom an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my\\ncircumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here--nor\\nwill I stop for _you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse\\nthan absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was\\nalready bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,\\nproviding with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of\\nmaking myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my\\nresolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage\\nher alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and\\nopenly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains\\nto display. But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours\\nthat were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with\\nher in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance--to\\nruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took\\nplace,\"--here he hesitated and looked down. \"Mrs. Smith had somehow or\\nother been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose\\ninterest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a\\nconnection--but I need not explain myself farther,\" he added, looking\\nat her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,--\"your\\nparticular intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long\\nago.\"\\n\\n\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart\\nanew against any compassion for him, \"I have heard it all. And how you\\nwill explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I\\nconfess is beyond my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received the account.\\nCould it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her\\ncharacter ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify\\nmyself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have\\nnothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\\nand because _I_ was a libertine, _she_ must be a saint. If the\\nviolence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not\\nmean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better\\ntreatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the\\ntenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any\\nreturn. I wish--I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured\\nmore than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for\\nme--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose\\nmind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"\\n\\n\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say\\nit, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well\\nbe--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do\\nnot think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of\\nunderstanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\\nYou must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in\\nDevonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was\\nreduced to the extremest indigence.\"\\n\\n\"But, upon my soul, I did _not_ know it,\" he warmly replied; \"I did\\nnot recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common\\nsense might have told her how to find it out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"\\n\\n\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be\\nguessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her\\nignorance of the world,--every thing was against me. The matter itself\\nI could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was\\npreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in\\ngeneral, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,\\nthe very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my\\npresent visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I\\nmight have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman!\\nshe offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could\\nnot be; and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.\\nThe night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was\\nspent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The\\nstruggle was great, but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne,\\nmy thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all\\ninsufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of\\nthose false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally\\ninclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to\\nbelieve myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her,\\nand I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence\\nremained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I\\ncould leave Devonshire: I was engaged to dine with you on that very\\nday; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this\\nengagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in\\nperson, was a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be\\ndreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep\\nto my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own\\nmagnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her\\nmiserable, and left her miserable;--and left her hoping never to see\\nher again.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor, reproachfully; \"a\\nnote would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to\\ncall?\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I was formally dismissed._\"]\\n\\n\"It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the\\ncountry in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the\\nneighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between\\nMrs. Smith and myself, and I resolved therefore on calling at the\\ncottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however,\\nwas really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.\\nYou were all gone I do not know where. I had left her only the evening\\nbefore, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A\\nfew hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how\\nhappy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to\\nAllenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in\\nthis, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense\\nof guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her\\nsorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I\\nwas obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forget\\nit--united too with such reliance, such confidence in me! Oh, God!\\nwhat a hard-hearted rascal I was!\"\\n\\nThey were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.\\n\\n\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently; \"less than\\nwas due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more\\nthan was justified by the future. I cannot think of it. It won\\'t do.\\nThen came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her\\nkindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it _did_ torture me. I was\\nmiserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\\ngives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself\\nfor the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past\\nsufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I\\nwent, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was\\nonly indifferent. My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,\\nand therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own\\nreflections so cheerful--when I looked forward every thing so\\ninviting!--when I looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh,\\nit was a blessed journey!\"\\n\\nHe stopped.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for\\nhis departure, \"and this is all?\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter?\\nDid she show it you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"\\n\\n\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was\\nin town the whole time,) what I felt is, in the common phrase, not to\\nbe expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any\\nemotion, my feelings were very, very painful. Every line, every word\\nwas--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,\\nwould forbid--a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town\\nwas, in the same language, a thunderbolt. Thunderbolts and daggers!\\nwhat a reproof would she have given me! her taste, her opinions--I\\nbelieve they are better known to me than my own, and I am sure they\\nare dearer.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this\\nextraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it\\nher duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.\\n\\n\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby. Remember that you are married.\\nRelate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to\\nhear.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne\\'s note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in\\nformer days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been\\nseparated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of\\nfaith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse. I say\\nawakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in\\nsome measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened\\nvillain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and choosing to fancy\\nthat she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of\\nour past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my\\nshoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\\novercoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, \\'I shall be\\nheartily glad to hear she is well married.\\' But this note made me know\\nmyself better. I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any\\nother woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But\\nevery thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat\\nwas impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no\\nanswer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her\\nfarther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call\\nin Berkeley Street; but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of\\na cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all\\nsafely out of the house one morning, and left my name.\"\\n\\n\"Watched us out of the house!\"\\n\\n\"Even so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how\\noften I was on the point of falling in with you. I have entered many a\\nshop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did\\nin Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a\\nglimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant\\nwatchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep\\nout of your sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the\\nMiddletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was\\nlikely to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in\\ntown, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of\\nhis coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings\\'s. He\\nasked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening. Had he _not_\\ntold me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I\\nshould have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The\\nnext morning brought another short note from Marianne--still\\naffectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything that could make\\n_my_ conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried--but could\\nnot frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of\\nthe day. If you _can_ pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it\\nwas _then._ With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced\\nto play the happy lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks\\nwere worse than all. Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were\\nforced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony\\nit was! Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me\\nWilloughby in such a tone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking\\nme for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such\\nspeaking solicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on\\nthe other hand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is\\nover now. Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could;\\nbut not before I had seen Marianne\\'s sweet face as white as death.\\n_That_ was the last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in\\nwhich she appeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought\\nof her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to\\nimagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her\\nlast in this world. She was before me, constantly before me, as I\\ntravelled, in the same look and hue.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight._\"]\\n\\nA short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. Willoughby first\\nrousing himself, broke it thus:\\n\\n\"Well, let me make haste and be gone. Your sister is certainly better,\\ncertainly out of danger?\"\\n\\n\"We are assured of it.\"\\n\\n\"Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing\\nto say about that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, _that_ in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you\\nknow, the very next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting\\nat the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought to me\\nthere from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia\\'s eye before it\\ncaught mine;--and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing\\naltogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague report had\\nreached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire,\\nand what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had\\nmarked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever.\\nAffecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a\\nwoman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents.\\nShe was well paid for her impudence. She read what made her wretched.\\nHer wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion--her malice--at all\\nevents it must be appeased. And, in short, what do you think of my\\nwife\\'s style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was\\nit not?\"\\n\\n\"Your wife! The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as\\nI was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her own--her own\\nhappy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do! we were\\nengaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--but I am\\ntalking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her money was\\nnecessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be\\ndone to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my\\ncharacter in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what\\nlanguage my answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My\\nbusiness was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with\\na bow or a bluster was of little importance. \\'I am ruined for ever in\\ntheir opinion,\\' said I to myself; \\'I am shut out for ever from their\\nsociety, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter\\nwill only make them think me a blackguard one.\\' Such were my\\nreasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my\\nwife\\'s words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne. Her three\\nnotes--unluckily they were all in my pocket-book, or I should have\\ndenied their existence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put\\nthem up, and could not even kiss them. And the lock of hair--that too\\nI had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now\\nsearched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear\\nlock--all, every memento was torn from me.\"\\n\\n\"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,\" said Elinor,\\nwhile her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate\\nemotion; \"you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs.\\nWilloughby or my sister. You had made your own choice. It was not\\nforced on you. Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your\\nrespect, at least. She must be attached to you, or she would not have\\nmarried you. To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly\\nis no atonement to Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own\\nconscience.\"\\n\\n\"Do not talk to me of my wife,\" said he with a heavy sigh. \"She does\\nnot deserve your compassion. She knew I had no regard for her when we\\nmarried. Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be\\nhappy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay. And now do you pity\\nme, Miss Dashwood? or have I said all this to no purpose? Am I,--be\\nit only one degree,--am I less guilty in your opinion than I was\\nbefore? My intentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any\\npart of my guilt?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little. You have proved\\nyourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have\\nproved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly\\nknow--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could\\nhave made it worse.\"\\n\\n\"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have\\nbeen telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as\\nwell as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me\\nbe able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my\\npresent feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural,\\nmore gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my\\npenitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if\\nyou will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be\\ncalled, your justification. But you have not explained to me the\\nparticular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her\\nillness.\"\\n\\n\"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton,\\nand when he saw who I was, for the first time these two months--he\\nspoke to me. That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen\\nwithout surprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured,\\nhonest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for\\nyour sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he\\nknew ought to, though probably he did not think it _would_, vex me\\nhorridly. As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that\\nMarianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter\\nthat morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most\\nimminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much\\nshocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the\\nundiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;\\nand so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he\\nalmost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise\\nabout a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister was\\ndying, and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,\\nscorning, hating me in her latest moments--for how could I tell what\\nhorrid projects might not have been imputed? _One_ person I was sure\\nwould represent me as capable of any thing. What I felt was dreadful!\\nMy resolution was soon made, and at eight o\\'clock this morning I was\\nin my carriage. Now you know all.\"\\n\\nElinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on the\\nirreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent\\nhabits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the\\ncharacter, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person\\nand talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a\\nfeeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him extravagant and\\nvain--Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.\\nVanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of\\nanother, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or\\nat least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each\\nfaulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to\\npunishment. The attachment, from which against honour, against\\nfeeling, against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself,\\nnow, when no longer allowable, governed every thought; and the\\nconnection, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left\\nher sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to\\nhimself of a far more incurable nature. From a reverie of this kind\\nshe was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby, who,\\nrousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful, started up in\\npreparation for going, and said--\\n\\n\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going back to town?\"\\n\\n\"No--to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a\\nday or two. Good bye.\"\\n\\nHe held out his hand. She could not refuse to give him hers;--he\\npressed it with affection.\\n\\n\"And you _do_ think something better of me than you did?\"--said he,\\nletting it fall, and leaning against the mantelpiece as if forgetting\\nhe was to go.\\n\\nElinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave, pitied, wished him\\nwell--was even interested in his happiness--and added some gentle\\ncounsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His answer was\\nnot very encouraging.\\n\\n\"As to that,\" said he, \"I must rub through the world as well as I can.\\nDomestic happiness is out of the question. If, however, I am allowed\\nto think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions,\\nit may be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may be\\nsomething to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.\\nWere I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--\"\\n\\nElinor stopped him with a reproof.\\n\\n\"Well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye. I shall now go away and live\\nin dread of one event.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Your sister\\'s marriage.\"\\n\\n\"You are very wrong. She can never be more lost to you than she is\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"But she will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should\\nbe the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear--but I will not\\nstay to rob myself of all your compassionate good-will, by showing that\\nwhere I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,--God bless\\nyou!\"\\n\\nAnd with these words, he almost ran out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV\\n\\n\\nElinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the\\nsound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a\\ncrowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness\\nwas the general result, to think even of her sister.\\n\\nWilloughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the\\nmost worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited\\na degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which\\nmade her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with\\na tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged\\nwithin herself--to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his\\ninfluence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought\\nnot in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\\nthat open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to\\npossess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not\\neven innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long\\nbefore she could feel his influence less.\\n\\nWhen at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her\\njust awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of\\nher hopes. Elinor\\'s heart was full. The past, the present, the future,\\nWilloughby\\'s visit, Marianne\\'s safety, and her mother\\'s expected\\narrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept\\noff every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of\\nbetraying herself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in which\\nthat fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby\\'s\\nleaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of\\nanother carriage. Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary\\nmoment\\'s horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and\\nreached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as\\nshe entered it.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced\\nalmost the conviction of Marianne\\'s being no more, had no voice to\\ninquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but _she_, waiting\\nneither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;\\nand her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment\\nas much overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her\\nfears. She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter\\nand her friend; and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\\nto speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at\\nintervals to press Colonel Brandon\\'s hand, with a look which spoke at\\nonce her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in\\nthe bliss of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even\\ngreater than her own.\\n\\nAs soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was\\nher first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,\\nrendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.\\nElinor\\'s delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only\\nchecked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther\\nsleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when\\nthe life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing\\nher mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for\\nconversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by\\nevery nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her all\\nnight; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother\\'s entreaty, went to\\nbed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours\\nof the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by\\nirritation of spirits. Willoughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now\\nallowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would\\nnot but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now\\nacquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before. But her\\npromise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful. She\\ndreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne\\nmight be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be\\nhappy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.\\nThen, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to\\n_his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far more than to his rival\\'s, the\\nreward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.\\nWilloughby\\'s death.\\n\\nThe shock of Colonel Brandon\\'s errand at Barton had been much softened\\nto Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her\\nuneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out\\nfor Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further\\nintelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\\nthat the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret\\naway, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be\\ninfection.\\n\\nMarianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness\\nof Mrs. Dashwood\\'s looks and spirits proved her to be, as she\\nrepeatedly declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.\\nElinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without\\nsometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But\\nMrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own\\ndisappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the\\nexuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it.\\nMarianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began\\nto feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\\nattachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her; and in her\\nrecovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It\\nwas thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private\\nconference between them occurred.\\n\\n\"At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my\\nhappiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself.\"\\n\\nHer daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and\\nnot surprised, was all silent attention.\\n\\n\"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your\\ncomposure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my\\nfamily, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon\\'s marrying one of you\\nas the object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most\\nhappy with him of the two.\"\\n\\nElinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because\\nsatisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their\\nage, characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must\\nalways be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject,\\nand therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.\\n\\n\"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came\\nout quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could\\ntalk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress; I\\nsaw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere\\nfriendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a\\nsympathy--or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to\\nirresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender,\\nconstant, affection for Marianne. He has loved her, my Elinor, ever\\nsince the first moment of seeing her.\"\\n\\nHere, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the\\nprofessions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her\\nmother\\'s active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her\\nas it chose.\\n\\n\"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby\\never felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant,\\nwhich ever we are to call it, has subsisted through all the knowledge\\nof dear Marianne\\'s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!\\nand without selfishness, without encouraging a hope! could he have\\nseen her happy with another. Such a noble mind! such openness, such\\nsincerity! No one can be deceived in _him._\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon\\'s character,\" said Elinor, \"as an excellent man, is\\nwell established.\"\\n\\n\"I know it is,\" replied her mother seriously, \"or after such a\\nwarning, I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to\\nbe pleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active,\\nsuch ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of\\nmen.\"\\n\\n\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest on _one_ act\\nof kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of\\nthe case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the\\nMiddletons, he has been long and intimately known; they equally love\\nand respect him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately\\nacquired, is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem\\nhim, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as\\nyourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the\\nworld. What answer did you give him? Did you allow him to hope?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.\\nMarianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or\\nencouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible\\neffusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet\\nafter a time I _did_ say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if\\nshe lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in\\npromoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful\\nsecurity, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\\nencouragement in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him, will\\ndo everything; Marianne\\'s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a\\nman as Willoughby. His own merits must soon secure it.\"\\n\\n\"To judge from the Colonel\\'s spirits, however, you have not yet made\\nhim equally sanguine.\"\\n\\n\"No. He thinks Marianne\\'s affection too deeply rooted for any change\\nin it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again\\nfree, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a\\ndifference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There,\\nhowever, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as\\nto be an advantage, as to make his character and principles\\nfixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very\\none to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are\\nall in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is\\nnot so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is\\nsomething much more pleasing in his countenance. There was always a\\nsomething,--if you remember,--in Willoughby\\'s eyes at times, which I\\ndid not like.\"\\n\\nElinor could _not_ remember it;--but her mother, without waiting for\\nher assent, continued--\\n\\n\"And his manners, the Colonel\\'s manners are not only more pleasing to\\nme than Willoughby\\'s ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to\\nbe more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their\\ngenuine attention to other people, and their manly unstudied\\nsimplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition, than the\\nliveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am\\nvery sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as\\nhe has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been\\nso happy with _him_ as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\"\\n\\nShe paused. Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her\\ndissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.\\n\\n\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\" added Mrs.\\nDashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,--for I\\nhear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly _must_ be some\\nsmall house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as\\nour present situation.\"\\n\\nPoor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but\\nher spirit was stubborn.\\n\\n\"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know, everybody cares\\nabout _that_;--and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it\\nreally is, I am sure it must be a good one.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and\\nElinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to\\nher friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVI\\n\\n\\nMarianne\\'s illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long\\nenough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength,\\nand her mother\\'s presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to\\nenable her to remove, within four days after the arrival of the\\nlatter, into Mrs. Palmer\\'s dressing-room. When there, at her own\\nparticular request, for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to\\nhim for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.\\n\\nHis emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in\\nreceiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was\\nsuch, as, in Elinor\\'s conjecture, must arise from something more than\\nhis affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to\\nothers; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many\\npast scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance\\nbetween Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened\\nby the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\\nand the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but\\nwith a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to\\nvery different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel\\'s behaviour but what\\narose from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the\\nactions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that\\nsomething more than gratitude already dawned.\\n\\nAt the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger\\nevery twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her\\ndaughter\\'s wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On _her_\\nmeasures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not\\nquit Cleveland during the Dashwoods\\' stay; and Colonel Brandon was\\nsoon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there\\nas equally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs.\\nJennings\\'s united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to\\naccept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better\\naccommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint\\ninvitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active\\ngood-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well\\nas herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the\\ncottage, in the course of a few weeks.\\n\\nThe day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after\\ntaking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so\\nearnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due\\nto her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and\\nbidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was\\ncarefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed\\nanxious that she should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and\\nElinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk\\nof the travellers, and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings\\nwas summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\\nfor the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon\\nimmediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey\\non both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous\\naffection, the most solicitous care could do to render her\\ncomfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found\\ntheir reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To\\nElinor, the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She,\\nwho had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by\\nanguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor\\nfortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally\\nshare, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as\\nshe trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to\\ncontentment and cheerfulness.\\n\\nAs they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which\\nevery field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful\\nrecollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her\\nface from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But\\nhere, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she\\nassisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw\\nonly an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender\\nthan pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole\\nof her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened\\nto reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common\\nsitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of\\nresolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the\\nsight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\\nbe connected. She said little, but every sentence aimed at\\ncheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed\\naway without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her\\npiano-forte. She went to it; but the music on which her eye first\\nrested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some\\nof their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\\nin his hand-writing. That would not do. She shook her head, put the\\nmusic aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained\\nof feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again;\\ndeclaring however with firmness as she did so, that she should in\\nfuture practice much.\\n\\nThe next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the\\ncontrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked\\nand spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\\nMargaret\\'s return, and talking of the dear family party which would\\nthen be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as\\nthe only happiness worth a wish.\\n\\n\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,\" said\\nshe, \"we will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the\\nfarm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will\\nwalk to Sir John\\'s new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\\nand we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its\\nfoundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we shall\\nbe happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never to be\\nlater in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall\\ndivide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan,\\nand am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own\\nlibrary is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing\\nbeyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at\\nthe Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know\\nI can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I\\nshall gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction\\nwhich I now feel myself to want.\"\\n\\nElinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;\\nthough smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her\\nto the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work\\nin introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and\\nvirtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\nremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared\\nshe had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of\\nMarianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy\\ntranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved\\nto wait till her sister\\'s health were more secure, before she\\nappointed it. But the resolution was made only to be broken.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_And see how the children go on._\"]\\n\\nMarianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was\\nfine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a\\nsoft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter\\'s\\nwishes and the mother\\'s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor\\'s\\narm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in\\nthe lane before the house.\\n\\nThe sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in\\nan exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had\\nadvanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the\\nhill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned\\ntowards it, Marianne calmly said--\\n\\n\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand, \"on that projecting\\nmound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.\"\\n\\nHer voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\\n\\n\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the\\nspot! shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\" hesitatingly it was\\nsaid. \"Or will it be wrong? I can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought\\nto do.\"\\n\\nElinor tenderly invited her to be open.\\n\\n\"As for regret,\" said Marianne, \"I have done with that, as far as _he_\\nis concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have\\nbeen for him, but what they are _now._ At present, if I could be\\nsatisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not\\n_always_ acting a part, not _always_ deceiving me; but above all, if I\\ncould be assured that he never was so _very_ wicked as my fears have\\nsometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl--\"\\n\\nShe stopped. Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered--\\n\\n\"If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it\\nhorrible to suspect a person, who has been what _he_ has been to _me_,\\nof such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a\\nsituation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could\\nexpose me to--\"\\n\\n\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account for his behaviour?\"\\n\\n\"I would suppose him--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him!--only\\nfickle, very, very fickle.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more. She was debating within herself on the\\neligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till\\nMarianne were in stronger health; and they crept on for a few minutes\\nin silence.\\n\\n\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne at last with a\\nsigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant\\nthan my own. He will suffer enough in them.\"\\n\\n\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"\\n\\n\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with\\nyours.\"\\n\\n\"Our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\\n\\n\"They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let\\nyour kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness\\nhas made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious\\nrecollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was\\nperfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own\\nbehaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn,\\nnothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness\\nto others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and\\nthat my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. My\\nillness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such\\nnegligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.\\nHad I died, it would have been self-destruction. I did not know my\\ndanger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these\\nreflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very\\neagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,\\nand to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died, in what peculiar\\nmisery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister! You, who\\nhad seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known\\nall the murmurings of my heart! How should I have lived in _your_\\nremembrance! My mother too! How could you have consoled her! I cannot\\nexpress my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the past,\\nI saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed\\ninjured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I\\nhad repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers,\\nthe Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and\\nunjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper\\nirritated by their very attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them,\\nlittle as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you\\nabove all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew\\nyour heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any\\ncompassion that could benefit you or myself. Your example was before me;\\nbut to what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I\\nimitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part\\nin those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which\\nyou had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew\\nyou to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away\\nfrom every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to\\nexist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had deserted and\\nwronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded\\naffection, to be miserable for my sake.\"\\n\\nHere ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,\\nimpatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly\\nthat praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well\\ndeserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied--\\n\\n\"You are very good. The future must be my proof. I have laid down my\\nplan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be\\ngoverned and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others,\\nnor torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my\\nmother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will\\nshare my affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I\\nshall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do\\nmix in other society, it will be only to show that my spirit is\\nhumbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the\\nlesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for\\nWilloughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him,\\nwould be idle. His remembrance can be overcome by no change of\\ncircumstances or opinions. But it shall be regulated, it shall be\\nchecked by religion, by reason, by constant employment.\"\\n\\nShe paused--and added in a low voice, \"If I could but know _his_\\nheart, everything would become easy.\"\\n\\nElinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or\\nimpropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at\\nall nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as\\nreflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\\nleading to the fact.\\n\\nShe managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her\\nanxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief\\npoints on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his\\nrepentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.\\nMarianne said not a word. She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the\\nground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A\\nthousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge\\none. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\\nunknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister\\'s, and tears\\ncovered her cheeks.\\n\\nElinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they\\nreached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her\\ncuriosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked\\nof nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was\\ncarefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where\\nminuteness could be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the\\nhouse, Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just\\narticulate through her tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister\\nand walked slowly up stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a\\nsolitude so reasonable as what she now sought; and with a mind\\nanxiously pre-arranging its result, and a resolution of reviving the\\nsubject again, should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the\\nparlour to fulfill her parting injunction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former\\nfavourite. She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his\\nimputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy. But the\\nfeelings of the past could not be recalled. Nothing could restore him\\nwith a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing\\ncould do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through\\nhis means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing\\ncould replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the\\ninterests of Colonel Brandon.\\n\\nHad Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby\\'s story from\\nhimself,--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence\\nof his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion\\nwould have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor\\'s power, nor in\\nher wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed\\nexplanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection\\nhad given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of\\nWilloughby\\'s deserts; she wished, therefore, to declare only the\\nsimple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his\\ncharacter, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy\\nastray.\\n\\nIn the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began\\nvoluntarily to speak of him again; but that it was not without an\\neffort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for\\nsome time previously sitting, her rising colour, as she spoke, and her\\nunsteady voice, plainly showed.\\n\\n\"I wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that I see every thing--as you\\ncan desire me to do.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing\\ntenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister\\'s\\nunbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence. Marianne\\nslowly continued--\\n\\n\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have\\nnow heard exactly what I wished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice\\nwas lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness\\nthan before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I\\nnever could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or\\nlater I must have known, all this. I should have had no confidence, no\\nesteem. Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother. \"Happy with a man of\\nlibertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest\\nof our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart\\nto be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitive\\nconscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband\\nought to have felt.\"\\n\\nMarianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"\\n\\n\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as a good mind and a\\nsound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as\\nwell as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,\\nreason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved\\nyou in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would\\nhave been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less\\ncertain. Had you married, you must have been always poor. His\\nexpensiveness is acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct\\ndeclares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His\\ndemands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income,\\nmust have brought on distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous\\nto you, from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before.\\n_Your_ sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when\\naware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear\\nto you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched\\nonly on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it,\\nbut beyond that--and how little could the utmost of your single\\nmanagement do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?\\nbeyond _that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge\\n_his_ enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing\\non feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your\\nown influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which\\nhad involved him in such difficulties?\"\\n\\nMarianne\\'s lips quivered, and she repeated the word \"Selfish?\" in a\\ntone that implied, \"do you really think him selfish?\"\\n\\n\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor, \"from the beginning to\\nthe end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was\\nselfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which\\nafterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\\nof it, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment,\\nor his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true. _My_ happiness never was his object.\"\\n\\n\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he has done. And why\\ndoes he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards\\nhimself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now\\nunembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks\\nonly that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than\\nyourself. But does it follow that had he married you, he would have\\nbeen happy?--The inconveniences would have been different. He would\\nthen have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they\\nare removed, he now reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of\\nwhose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always\\nnecessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank\\nthe innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far\\nmore importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a\\nwife.\"\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I have nothing to\\nregret--nothing but my own folly.\"\\n\\n\"Rather say your mother\\'s imprudence, my child,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;\\n\"_she_ must be answerable.\"\\n\\nMarianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each\\nfelt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that\\nmight weaken her sister\\'s spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first\\nsubject, immediately continued--\\n\\n\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the\\nstory--that all Willoughby\\'s difficulties have arisen from the first\\noffence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime\\nhas been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present\\ndiscontents.\"\\n\\nMarianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led\\nby it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon\\'s injuries and merits, warm\\nas friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her daughter did not\\nlook, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\\n\\nElinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three\\nfollowing days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she\\nhad done; but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried\\nto appear cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the\\neffect of time upon her health.\\n\\nMargaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each\\nother, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their\\nusual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to\\nBarton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\\n\\nElinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She had heard\\nnothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,\\nnothing certain even of his present abode. Some letters had passed\\nbetween her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne\\'s illness; and\\nin the first of John\\'s, there had been this sentence:--\"We know\\nnothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so\\nprohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford\"; which\\nwas all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,\\nfor his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\\nShe was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.\\n\\nTheir man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and\\nwhen, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his\\nmistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary\\ncommunication--\\n\\n\"I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"\\n\\nMarianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her\\nturning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood,\\nwhose eyes, as she answered the servant\\'s inquiry, had intuitively\\ntaken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor\\'s\\ncountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,\\nalike distressed by Marianne\\'s situation, knew not on which child to\\nbestow her principal attention.\\n\\nThe servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense\\nenough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood\\'s assistance,\\nsupported her into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather\\nbetter, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the\\nmaid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so\\nfar recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just\\nbeginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.\\nMrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor\\nhad the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is\\nmarried._\"]\\n\\n\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"\\n\\n\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma\\'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady\\ntoo, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in a chaise at the door of\\nthe New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the\\nPark to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look\\nup as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest\\nMiss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me,\\nand inquired after you, ma\\'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss\\nMarianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars\\'s,\\ntheir best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had\\nnot time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go\\nforwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but\\nhowever, when they come back, they\\'d make sure to come and see you.\"\\n\\n\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since\\nshe was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken\\nyoung lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy.\"\\n\\n\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look\\nup;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart could easily account for his not putting himself\\nforward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.\\n\\n\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, only they two.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know where they came from?\"\\n\\n\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.\"\\n\\n\"And are they going farther westward?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am--but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and\\nthen they\\'d be sure and call here.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than\\nto expect them. She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and\\nwas very confident that Edward would never come near them. She\\nobserved in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going\\ndown to Mr. Pratt\\'s, near Plymouth.\\n\\nThomas\\'s intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she wished to\\nhear more.\\n\\n\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any\\nlonger; I was afraid of being late.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was\\nalways a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the\\ntablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.\\nMarianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.\\nMrs. Dashwood\\'s and Elinor\\'s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\\nmight think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as\\nboth her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had\\noften had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to\\ngo without her dinner before.\\n\\nWhen the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and\\nElinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a\\nsimilarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to\\nhazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She now\\nfound that she had erred in relying on Elinor\\'s representation of\\nherself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly\\nsoftened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,\\nsuffering as she then had suffered for Marianne. She found that she\\nhad been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her\\ndaughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well\\nunderstood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to\\nbelieve, or than it was now proved to be. She feared that under this\\npersuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to\\nher Elinor; that Marianne\\'s affliction, because more acknowledged,\\nmore immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness,\\nand led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter\\nsuffering almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and\\ngreater fortitude.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII\\n\\n\\nElinor now found the difference between the expectation of an\\nunpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,\\nand certainty itself. She now found, that in spite of herself, she had\\nalways admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something\\nwould occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his\\nown, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of\\nestablishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of\\nall. But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the\\nlurking flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the\\nintelligence.\\n\\nThat he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be\\nin orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the\\nliving, surprised her a little at first. But she soon saw how likely\\nit was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure\\nhim, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were\\nmarried, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle\\'s. What\\nhad Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her\\nmother\\'s servant, on hearing Lucy\\'s message!\\n\\nThey would soon, she supposed, be settled at\\nDelaford;--Delaford,--that place in which so much conspired to give\\nher an interest; which she wished to be acquainted with, and yet\\ndesired to avoid. She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house;\\nsaw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire\\nof smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be\\nsuspected of half her economical practices; pursuing her own interest\\nin every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs.\\nJennings, and of every wealthy friend. In Edward, she knew not what\\nshe saw, nor what she wished to see. Happy or unhappy, nothing pleased\\nher; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.\\n\\nElinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London\\nwould write to them to announce the event, and give farther\\nparticulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no\\ntidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault\\nwith every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.\\n\\n\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma\\'am?\" was an inquiry which\\nsprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.\\n\\n\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to\\nhear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should\\nnot be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"\\n\\nThis was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel\\nBrandon must have some information to give.\\n\\nScarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on\\nhorseback drew her eyes to the window. He stopped at their gate. It\\nwas a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear\\nmore; and she trembled in expectation of it. But--it was _not_ Colonel\\nBrandon--neither his air--nor his height. Were it possible, she must\\nsay it must be Edward. She looked again. He had just dismounted;--she\\ncould not be mistaken,--it _was_ Edward. She moved away and sat down.\\n\"He comes from Mr. Pratt\\'s purposely to see us. I _will_ be calm, I\\n_will_ be mistress of myself.\"\\n\\nIn a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the\\nmistake. She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look\\nat herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. She would have\\ngiven the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that\\nshe hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to\\nhim;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their\\nown discretion.\\n\\nNot a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the\\nappearance of their visitor. His footsteps were heard along the gravel\\npath; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before\\nthem.\\n\\nHis countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for\\nElinor. His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if\\nfearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\\nMrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of\\nthat daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be\\nguided in every thing, met him with a look of forced complacency, gave\\nhim her hand, and wished him joy.\\n\\n[Illustration: _It was Edward._]\\n\\nHe coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor\\'s lips\\nhad moved with her mother\\'s, and, when the moment of action was over,\\nshe wished that she had shaken hands with him too. But it was then too\\nlate, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again\\nand talked of the weather.\\n\\nMarianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal\\nher distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole\\nof the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and\\ntherefore took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a\\nstrict silence.\\n\\nWhen Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very\\nawful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who\\nfelt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a\\nhurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.\\n\\nAnother pause.\\n\\nElinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own\\nvoice, now said--\\n\\n\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"\\n\\n\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise. \"No, my mother\\nis in town.\"\\n\\n\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, \"to\\ninquire for Mrs. _Edward_ Ferrars.\"\\n\\nShe dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their\\neyes on him. He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,\\nafter some hesitation, said,--\\n\\n\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. _Robert_ Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an\\naccent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,\\neven _her_ eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. He\\nrose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not\\nknowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and\\nwhile spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to\\npieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice--\\n\\n\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is\\nlately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.\"\\n\\nHis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but\\nElinor, who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of\\nsuch agitation as made her hardly know where she was.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.\"\\n\\nElinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and as\\nsoon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first\\nshe thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any\\nwhere, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw, or\\neven heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a\\nreverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of\\nMrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word,\\nquitted the room, and walked out towards the village, leaving the\\nothers in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his\\nsituation, so wonderful and so sudden,--a perplexity which they had no\\nmeans of lessening but by their own conjectures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX\\n\\n\\nUnaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might\\nappear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and\\nto what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily\\npre-determined by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of _one_\\nimprudent engagement, contracted without his mother\\'s consent, as he\\nhad already done for more than four years, nothing less could be\\nexpected of him in the failure of _that_, than the immediate\\ncontraction of another.\\n\\nHis errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask\\nElinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether\\ninexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should\\nfeel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in\\nneed of encouragement and fresh air.\\n\\nHow soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however,\\nhow soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he\\nexpressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly\\ntold. This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at\\nfour o\\'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his\\nlady, engaged her mother\\'s consent, and was not only in the rapturous\\nprofession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\\nof the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly\\njoyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to\\nswell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any\\nreproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his\\nmisery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love; and elevated at\\nonce to that security with another, which he must have thought of\\nalmost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with\\ndesire. He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to\\nhappiness; and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,\\nflowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in\\nhim before.\\n\\nHis heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors\\nconfessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all\\nthe philosophic dignity of twenty-four.\\n\\n\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\" said he, \"the\\nconsequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment. Had my\\nmother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen\\nfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never\\nhave happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at\\nthe time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I\\nthen had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a\\ndistance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown\\nthe fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as\\nin such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do,\\ninstead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to\\nchoose any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the\\nfirst twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,\\nwhich belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not\\nentered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the\\nworld to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not\\nmake my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no\\ncompanion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not\\nunnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt\\nmyself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I\\nspent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen:\\nLucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty\\ntoo--at least I thought so _then_; and I had seen so little of other\\nwomen, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects.\\nConsidering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement\\nwas, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at\\nthe time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly.\"\\n\\nThe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the\\nhappiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all,\\nthe satisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be\\ncomfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough,\\nhow to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his\\ndelicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\\nconversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and\\nsociety of both.\\n\\nMarianne could speak _her_ happiness only by tears. Comparisons would\\noccur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love\\nfor her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor\\nlanguage.\\n\\nBut Elinor--how are _her_ feelings to be described? From the moment of\\nlearning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to\\nthe moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly\\nfollowed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the\\nsecond moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude\\nremoved, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw\\nhim honourably released from his former engagement,--saw him instantly\\nprofiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection\\nas tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was\\noppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity; and happily disposed\\nas is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the\\nbetter, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits,\\nor any degree of tranquillity to her heart.\\n\\nEdward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever\\nother claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a\\nweek should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor\\'s company, or\\nsuffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and\\nthe future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of\\nincessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in\\ncommon between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is\\ndifferent. Between _them_ no subject is finished, no communication is\\neven made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.\\n\\nLucy\\'s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,\\nformed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and\\nElinor\\'s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in\\nevery view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable\\ncircumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together,\\nand by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of\\nwhose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any\\nadmiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose\\naccount that brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond\\nher comprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful\\naffair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her\\nreason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.\\n\\nEdward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,\\nat first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so\\nworked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all\\nthe rest. Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,\\nof his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother\\'s affairs\\nmight have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.\\n\\n\"_That_ was exactly like Robert,\" was his immediate observation. \"And\\n_that_,\" he presently added, \"might perhaps be in _his_ head when the\\nacquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might\\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs\\nmight afterward arise.\"\\n\\nHow long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally\\nat a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had\\nremained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no\\nmeans of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very\\nlast were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not\\nthe smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him\\nfor what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from\\nLucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified\\nbetween the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He\\nput the letter into Elinor\\'s hands.\\n\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\\n     \"Being very sure I have long lost your affections, I have\\n     thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and\\n     have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to\\n     think I might be with you; but I scorn to accept a hand\\n     while the heart was another\\'s. Sincerely wish you happy in\\n     your choice, and it shall not be my fault if we are not\\n     always good friends, as our near relationship now makes\\n     proper. I can safely say I owe you no ill-will, and am sure\\n     you will be too generous to do us any ill offices. Your\\n     brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could\\n     not live without one another, we are just returned from the\\n     altar, and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks,\\n     which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,\\n     but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines,\\n     and shall always remain--\\n\\n     \"Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\\n\\n     \"LUCY FERRARS.\"\\n\\n     \"I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture\\n     the first opportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls--but the\\n     ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep.\"\\n\\nElinor read and returned it without any comment.\\n\\n\"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\" said Edward.\\n\"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by _you_ in\\nformer days. In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife! how I have\\nblushed over the pages of her writing! and I believe I may say that\\nsince the first half year of our foolish business this is the only\\nletter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any\\namends for the defect of the style.\"\\n\\n\"However it may have come about,\" said Elinor, after a pause,--\"they\\nare certainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most\\nappropriate punishment. The independence she settled on Robert,\\nthrough resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his\\nown choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\\na-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for\\nintending to do. She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert\\'s\\nmarrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.\"\\n\\n\"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite. She\\nwill be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him\\nmuch sooner.\"\\n\\nIn what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew\\nnot, for no communication with any of his family had yet been\\nattempted by him. He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours\\nafter Lucy\\'s letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the\\nnearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of\\nconduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate\\nconnection. He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\\nMiss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking _that_ fate, it is to be\\nsupposed, in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of\\nColonel Brandon, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own\\ndeserts, and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts, he did\\nnot, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception. It was his\\nbusiness, however, to say that he _did_, and he said it very prettily.\\nWhat he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after, must be referred\\nto the imagination of husbands and wives.\\n\\nThat Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of\\nmalice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to\\nElinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her\\ncharacter, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost\\nmeanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,\\neven before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a\\nwant of liberality in some of her opinions, they had been equally\\nimputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter\\nreached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\\ngood-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but\\nsuch a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an\\nengagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to\\nhis mother\\'s anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret\\nto him.\\n\\n\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings, to give\\nher the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was\\nrenounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend\\nin the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there\\nseemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living\\ncreature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly\\ninsisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but\\nthe most disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I\\ncannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage\\nit could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the\\nsmallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.\\nShe could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.\"\\n\\n\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;\\nthat your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost\\nnothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it\\nfettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was\\ncertainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration\\namong her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it\\nwould be better for her to marry _you_ than be single.\"\\n\\nEdward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have\\nbeen more natural than Lucy\\'s conduct, nor more self-evident than the\\nmotive of it.\\n\\nElinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence\\nwhich compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them\\nat Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.\\n\\n\"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she; \"because--to say\\nnothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to\\nfancy and expect _what_, as you were _then_ situated, could never be.\"\\n\\nHe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken\\nconfidence in the force of his engagement.\\n\\n\"I was simple enough to think, that because my _faith_ was plighted to\\nanother, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the\\nconsciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred\\nas my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only\\nfriendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and\\nLucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I _was_\\nwrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I\\nreconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than\\nthese:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but\\nmyself.\"\\n\\nElinor smiled, and shook her head.\\n\\nEdward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon\\'s being expected at the\\nCottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with\\nhim, but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer\\nresented his giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\"\\nsaid he, \"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the\\noccasion, he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.\"\\n\\n_Now_ he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the\\nplace. But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed\\nall his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the\\nparish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor\\nherself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard\\nit with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.\\n\\nOne question after this only remained undecided, between them, one\\ndifficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by\\nmutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness\\ncertain--and they only wanted something to live upon. Edward had two\\nthousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all\\nthat they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.\\nDashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite\\nenough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year\\nwould supply them with the comforts of life.\\n\\nEdward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his\\nmother towards him; and on _that_ he rested for the residue of their\\nincome. But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would\\nstill be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his choosing herself had\\nbeen spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars\\'s flattering language as only a lesser\\nevil than his choosing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert\\'s offence\\nwould serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.\\n\\nAbout four days after Edward\\'s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to\\ncomplete Mrs. Dashwood\\'s satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of\\nhaving, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company\\nwith her than her house would hold. Edward was allowed to retain the\\nprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every\\nnight to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned\\nin the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers\\' first\\ntÍte-‡-tÍte before breakfast.\\n\\nA three weeks\\' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at\\nleast, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between\\nthirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\\nwhich needed all the improvement in Marianne\\'s looks, all the kindness\\nof her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother\\'s language, to\\nmake it cheerful. Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he\\ndid revive. No rumour of Lucy\\'s marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\\nnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were\\nconsequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was\\nexplained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to\\nrejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it\\npromoted the interest of Elinor.\\n\\nIt would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good\\nopinion of each other, as they advanced in each other\\'s acquaintance,\\nfor it could not be otherwise. Their resemblance in good principles\\nand good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other\\nattraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters\\nfond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.\\n\\nThe letters from town, which a few days before would have made every\\nnerve in Elinor\\'s body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read\\nwith less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the\\nwonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting\\ngirl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she\\nwas sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by\\nall accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford. \"I do think,\" she\\ncontinued, \"nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two\\ndays before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul\\nsuspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came\\ncrying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs.\\nFerrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it\\nseems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on\\npurpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven\\nshillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas\\nto take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four\\nweeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the\\nDoctor again. And I must say that Lucy\\'s crossness not to take them\\nalong with them in the chaise is worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I\\ncannot get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton,\\nand Miss Marianne must try to comfort him.\"\\n\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most\\nunfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of\\nsensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such a\\nblow, with grateful wonder. Robert\\'s offence was unpardonable, but\\nLucy\\'s was infinitely worse. Neither of them were ever again to be\\nmentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced\\nto forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her\\ndaughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence. The secrecy with\\nwhich everything had been carried on between them, was rationally\\ntreated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any\\nsuspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have\\nbeen taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join\\nwith him in regretting that Lucy\\'s engagement with Edward had not\\nrather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of\\nspreading misery farther in the family. He thus continued:--\\n\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward\\'s name, which does not\\nsurprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been\\nreceived from him on the occasion. Perhaps, however, he is kept silent\\nby his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by\\na line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper\\nsubmission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shown to\\nher mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness\\nof Mrs. Ferrars\\'s heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to\\nbe on good terms with her children.\"\\n\\nThis paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of\\nEdward. It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not\\nexactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\\n\\n\"A letter of proper submission!\" repeated he; \"would they have me beg\\nmy mother\\'s pardon for Robert\\'s ingratitude to _her_, and breach of\\nhonour to _me_? I can make no submission. I am grown neither humble\\nnor penitent by what has passed. I am grown very happy; but that would\\nnot interest. I know of no submission that _is_ proper for me to\\nmake.\"\\n\\n\"You may certainly ask to be forgiven,\" said Elinor, \"because you have\\noffended;--and I should think you might _now_ venture so far as to\\nprofess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew\\non you your mother\\'s anger.\"\\n\\nHe agreed that he might.\\n\\n\"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be\\nconvenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as\\nimprudent in _her_ eyes as the first.\"\\n\\nHe had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a\\nletter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,\\nas he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by\\nword of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing\\nto Fanny, he should go to London, and personally entreat her good\\noffices in his favour. \"And if they really _do_ interest themselves,\"\\nsaid Marianne, in her new character of candour, \"in bringing about a\\nreconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not\\nentirely without merit.\"\\n\\nAfter a visit on Colonel Brandon\\'s side of only three or four days,\\nthe two gentlemen quitted Barton together. They were to go immediately\\nto Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his\\nfuture home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\\nimprovements were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a\\ncouple of nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L\\n\\n\\nAfter a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent\\nand so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always\\nseemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward\\nwas admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\\n\\nHer family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of\\nher life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of\\nEdward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar\\nannihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and\\nnow, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\\n\\nIn spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not\\nfeel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his\\npresent engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he\\nfeared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him\\noff as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was\\nrevealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs.\\nFerrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\\nMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power; told him, that in Miss\\nMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune; and\\nenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\\nof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was\\nonly the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three_;\\nbut when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\\nrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\\njudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit; and\\ntherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\\ndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\\nissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\\n\\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next\\nto be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was\\nnow her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\\nobjection was made against Edward\\'s taking orders for the sake of two\\nhundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\\nthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\\nbeen given with Fanny.\\n\\nIt was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected,\\nby Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling\\nexcuses, seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\\n\\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\\nthey had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\\nliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\\nan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\\nconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\\ncompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\\nand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\\ntill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\\nchurch early in the autumn.\\n\\nThe first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at\\nthe Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of\\nthe Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the\\nspot;--could choose papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were\\nchiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in\\ntheir Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her\\nhusband, as she really believed, one of the happiest couples in the\\nworld. They had in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of\\nColonel Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for their\\ncows.\\n\\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost all their\\nrelations and friends. Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness\\nwhich she was almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the\\nDashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them\\nhonour.\\n\\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\" said John, as\\nthey were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\\nHouse, \"_that_ would be saying too much, for certainly you have been\\none of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I\\nconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\\nbrother. His property here, his place, his house,--every thing is in\\nsuch respectable and excellent condition! And his woods,--I have not\\nseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\\nDelaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly\\nthe person to attract him, yet I think it would altogether be\\nadvisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as\\nColonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may\\nhappen; for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of\\nanybody else,--and it will always be in your power to set her off to\\nadvantage, and so forth. In short, you may as well give her a chance;\\nYou understand me.\"\\n\\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars _did_ come to see them, and always treated\\nthem with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never\\ninsulted by her real favour and preference. _That_ was due to the\\nfolly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by\\nthem before many months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the\\nlatter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the\\nprincipal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful\\nhumility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the\\nsmallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars\\nto his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Everything in such respectable condition_]\\n\\nThe whole of Lucy\\'s behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\\ncrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging\\ninstance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest,\\nhowever its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing\\nevery advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\\nand conscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and\\nprivately visited her in Bartlett\\'s Buildings, it was only with the\\nview imputed to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to\\ngive up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but\\nthe affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two\\ninterviews would settle the matter. In that point, however, and that\\nonly, he erred; for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence\\nwould convince her in _time_, another visit, another conversation, was\\nalways wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered\\nin her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another\\nhalf hour\\'s discourse with himself. His attendance was by this means\\nsecured, and the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of\\nEdward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on\\nwhich he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she\\nsoon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, it\\nbecame speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his\\nbrother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and\\nvery proud of marrying privately without his mother\\'s consent. What\\nimmediately followed is known. They passed some months in great\\nhappiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances\\nto cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages; and from\\nthence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by\\nthe simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy\\'s instigation, was\\nadopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,\\ncomprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty\\nand therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\\nlonger unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and\\nmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert\\'s offence, and gratitude for\\nthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\\nnotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon\\nafterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and\\ninfluence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert\\nor Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having\\nonce intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in\\nfortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, _she_ was in every\\nthing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite\\nchild. They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from\\nMrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods;\\nand setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting\\nbetween Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part,\\nas well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy\\nthemselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived\\ntogether.\\n\\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\\npuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed\\nto it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement,\\nhowever, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing\\never appeared in Robert\\'s style of living or of talking to give a\\nsuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either\\nleaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if\\nEdward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\\nparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,\\nand from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed\\nno less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an\\nexchange.\\n\\nElinor\\'s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\\nbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely\\nuseless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their\\ntime with her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\\nas pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish\\nof bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less\\nearnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It\\nwas now her darling object. Precious as was the company of her\\ndaughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its\\nconstant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled\\nat the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They\\neach felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by\\ngeneral consent, was to be the reward of all.\\n\\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of\\nhis goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,\\nwhich at last, though long after it was observable to everybody\\nelse--burst on her--what could she do?\\n\\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to\\ndiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\\nconduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an\\naffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no\\nsentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily\\nto give her hand to another!--and _that_ other, a man who had suffered\\nno less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two\\nyears before, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still\\nsought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\\n\\nBut so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\\npassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,\\ninstead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her\\nonly pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm\\nand sober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at\\nnineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties,\\nplaced in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the\\npatroness of a village.\\n\\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\\nbelieved he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every\\npast affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to\\nanimation, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found\\nher own happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and\\ndelight of each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves;\\nand her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband,\\nas it had once been to Willoughby.\\n\\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness\\nof Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character,\\nas the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had\\nhe behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been\\nhappy and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought\\nits own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he\\nlong thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with\\nregret. But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from\\nsociety, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a\\nbroken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither. He lived to\\nexert, and frequently to enjoy himself. His wife was not always out of\\nhumour, nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses\\nand dogs, and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable\\ndegree of domestic felicity.\\n\\nFor Marianne, however, in spite of his incivility in surviving her\\nloss, he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\\nevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\\nperfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\\nin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\\nattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and\\nMrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had\\nreached an age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible\\nfor being supposed to have a lover.\\n\\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\\nwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the\\nmerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\\nas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost\\nwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreement\\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SENSE AND SENSIBILITY ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.
